"Never thought I'd get addicted to this game. In fact, my 4 year is addicted to this game. It's fun and challenging at the same time.",1
I love playing this game and still play it to this day. My only issue is that it is getting too difficult to pass.,1
All I know is that my kids love these birds the kindle version is great and mobile love this and suggest for all families.,1
1st I have to uninstall in order to get the new update. Now it crashes everytime I try to do any of the older levels. Rovio this is BS!!!!!!,0
I decided to get this app to learn why everyone kept talking about it. It's simple - it's fun and a bit of a mind bender. Just challenging enough to keep you occupied while you laugh at the set-ups. Good time.,1
"Amazing game! if you've never played Angry Birds before, start here!Its the new Pacman for sure!Great for kids, teens, and the elderly!",1
For those days you have to wait or try to keep your tongue this is the game.  I thought it was just for kids but no!!!  This is great and gets better and better the farther you go.  A must for folks that like to challenge their minds.,1

"Okay, this is by far the best you can get from a free game. This has about ten or more stages with about 30 levels on each,so we are talking about 300 or 400 levels - no joke! This game also comes with like 20 mini episodes ( also totally free) that you ",1
"This game is too much fun not to have.  I haven't had any problems with the App at all.  A challenging game for sure, but it is fun and funny. I had to go online to find out what each bird does but that was not an issue.",1
Got this app for my new Kindle Fire HD.  Had the app previously on my android phone.  This is so much better. Graphics looks great.  Havent played much b/c my hubby is addicted. LOL,1
"The last level on the newest stage is so hard that it can very close to rage quit, bui still like the entire game.",1

I tried playing this game but I have to get more involved with it. But now that the holidays are over I can start playing it again.,1
So much fun! I play it with everyone I know and recommend it a lot. The only issue is it sometimes freezes and/or makes me force close.,1

He loves anything that has to do with Angry Birds. Sure has helped me when I need to keep him occupied.,1

My wife got a Kindle and plays all the time more than reading her books. Shes better than I am,1
I had heard about this game and tried to see if I liked it. But what I found was the puzzles are too hard and I wasted a ridiculous amount of time attempting to solve them. I deleted the game from my tablet.,0
I Can't. Believe. That. Everyone. Is Talking About Ads. I haven't. seen any.  ads this is crazy and I don't see Dr appetite whatever Talking. to me. . This is crazy and Pyscho 1. People Are Talking. About ads 2. Its CrazyBut. Awesome. App Go Team Rovio! ,1

"Great game, loads of fun, even better on the Fire than on a smart phone, larger and easier to see while you take out evil pigs!",1
This game hooked me on Angry Birds. After this I had to go out and get even more angry birds.:),1
Despite becoming a pop culture Icon...this game goes down as one of the all time greets like Pac Man or Mario. Brothers. it holds up and continues to feel fresh no matter how many times you play. And who doesn't. try to get three stars on every level?,1
Kids love it. Entertainable will help pass some time in an enjoyable fashion. A great game that is free is always nice.,1
"I use to play this everyday, and I don't play a lot of games, but this game is highly addictive and fun.",1

"It is fun.  so many levels, it keeps on going.  I laugh each time I play itIt was recommended to me....and I would also recommend it.",1
It is great to download this game for free. I wish that I could get off the first level though. For some reason this level seems impossible.,1
I love it the graghics are really good and I am very picky about my games I don't really have many games so I just love it,1
I appsoluty adore this app. It is so much fun. I strongly encourage it. It is like making your own bacon or sausage. Luv it. :-),1
I love Angry Birds!  It is a challenge as well as addictive!  I've had it and my kindle since Christmas and it has given me hundreds of hours of pleasure!,1

Angry birds is such a good game. Pretty common too. It is about some birds who got their eggs stolen by pigs so now they're out to get them. All of them. You shoot a certain number of angry birds from a slingshot and try to get all the pigs with the limi,1
I think Angry Birds Free is great!  I play it both on my Kindle and online on Facebook too.  It is lots of fun!,1
"I love it so much, and it is so great, my mother is addicted to it!  You should make angry birds mario, but it is AWESOME!!! 5/5! Well, really 240000/5!",1
Would recommend this to others. Good for all ages and whole family likes this game. Can't wait to play other games.,1
what is it with these dang birds! I like this a lot...wierd game but interesting. I just can't stop trying to get to the next level!,1
I like to play this when I am trying to relax...it is fun trying to figure out the puzzles! This helps me calm down!,1
it is so fun but need new birds and new levels to play on and hf h g gvhvhbu. n b j h.,1

"Got so engrossed in the game that I forgot it was demo!  Will have to purchase because I want to get further!Majesty was great on my PC, and this app fits the bill also!",1
Installs but when run will send you to the webpage to buy the pay version. Then it just crashes when you try to run it again.Amazon should remove this free version and perhaps even the pay version.This is not good.,0
this was a real fail! its almost impossible to win and its really difficult to use!!! I don't even understand why I got it. it was immediately uninstalled.,0
won't even let me open it. its up for like 3 seconds and then closes. I want out. I don't even know how to uninstall this. I'm not very happy at all.,0
I love it at first its a little hard until u know what u r doing but once u r hood and know what u r doing its great,1
"I could not play this it was too boring and confusing I'm going to delete it of my kindle right after this, I wouldn't recommend getting this app",0
If youlook at teh other reviews you will notice people like this game when it works.  It's free so you might as well give it a shot.,1
"Great game unless you are stupid enough to download an app that doesnt work on your device, hence all the 1 star reviews.",1
Majesty is a very fun and adicting game.  i tried the trial version first and then bought the full game.  Trial version allows you to play several locations to give a taste of the game.  Purchasing the game opens up more content. i hope the devs will be ,1
First off the controls for this app are stupid because you can't control the heroes that you hire. they just walk where ever they want to go and the graphics are terrible. got this for my kindle fire and it wasn't even worth downloading for 5 minutes. wo,0
I do not like this one I liked the one on my old Kindle better it was bore fun and challenging to play,0
Got it and was not pleased. Had to delete it. Thought it would be better but fell short. I am sure I will find one that measures up at another time. Sorry this wasn't it.,0
"I allways like to play Black Jack,Even when I went to Las Vagus. But found this game to be A Good Teacher so when I go to Vagus Agin I will know A little more About the Game to win this time.",1
"this is the most amazing alarm i have ever even heard of!!!!!!! it is so easy to work, has the best alarm options, i could go on and on and on!! LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!",1
"This app is so good & easy to use I actually purchased the full version (& I don't purchase many Apps because I don't mind the advertisements). It is a must have App.  I use the clock, quick alarm & have many recurring alarms set.  You can silence your p",1
I set this alarm twice and it never went off...I'm not really sure why. Maybe I will try again at a later time but this didn't work at all for me on the Fire HD.,0
"i owned this app for probably three months. i've never had a problem i couldn't solve. the customizability is endless, i especially love being able to wake up to a different song in music library everyday. great stuff!",1
"I got this app as the free app of the day a while ago, I liked it so much I went over to the android market and paid for it!  I use this every morning and enjoy awakening to the nature sounds.",1
"This alarm clock is fantastic. I haven't got the full version but when I do I look forward to it. I have this app for my kindle fire and it works great. It has features that allow you to pick what song or melody to wake up to, do math problems before you",1
"Best alarm I have found.So many settings!  It is overwhelming at first, but once you get it dialed in, it is amazing.I have mine start 5 mins before I want to wake up, it begins with tiny trickles of water and slowly gets louder over the 5 mins (the scre",1
I love the app....if only you could buy regular mode for less. sometimes I need an alarm Wednesday but you can always have more than 1 app...the regular version is better,1
Repeatedly crashes on my Kindle Fire after asking if I want to install an add on. Maybe next version will be more compatible as this appears to be just what I want for sn alarm clock app.,0
Amazing alarm. There is something about it ringing gently minutes before the main loud alarm that makes you feel refreshed. I have not had a headache or felt groggy since I started using this alarm.,1
yes its Bejeweled but with enough of a twist to keep it interesting. runs perfectly on both my Samsung galexy prevail and my Acer iconia tab A500 with nice HD graphics on the tablet.,1
This one is fun and after each match 3 or more puzzle you get to buy pieces that help you in the puzzle. You don't spend any real money except for the cost of the game.,1
"If you like matching games, this one is well worth the money. Very polished graphics and gameplay, nothing like the tons of laggy, buggy free match games onthe market. Enough to keep my attention and want to keep playing.",1
I love this game! it plays just fine on my Acer a500 tablet. I played several levels and it ran smooth with no glitches. I will be playing this a lot. Thanks Amazon!,1
"Well done matching game that has great graphics on both my DroidX phone and Toshiba Thrive tablet.  I was given the choice to upload scores or not, as I wished.  The app can be moved to the sd card, too, which is something I like in an app.",1
"This is a jewel matching game.  Nice graphics and sound effects.  Satisfying game play. For those who have the Pandigital Novel, it works great on the 7"" screen. Also works great on my  Android phone.",1
"I hesitated to download this because of the review of a tablet. I took a chance and it runs great on my rooted flashback 7.1, honeycomb viewsonic gtab.  Runs great, good graphics, good game.",1
"This is a great &quot;bejewled&quot; type of game. The graphics are great and the combos keep things interesting. Unlike a lot of other match 3 games, the game feels like it is progressing and going somewhere, which I really liked. There are a bunch of l",1
Works fine on my Dell Streak 7 tablet. I've always liked matching games and this one has a lot more to offer than just matching tiles. Very colorful and works very smooth. I highly recommend it. You can also transfer it to your SD card.,1
"I got this game as the FAOTD. I can't say that I would have paid $1.99 for it, maybe $.99. The game is fun and addictive, but once it starts going fast and you get in the groove, the game is over. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of levels, but there ",1
"The graphics are great, and it runs really smooth on my HTC Incredible. Really fun and addictive! A must have game. Kudos to the dev.",1
This game is a lot of fun and designed perfectly for touch screen gameplay. It has great graphics and music and lots of levels to keep you entertained. I definitely recommend it.,1
"it's a great free game. very fun. even if it's a bejeweled clone, it's a good one with new gameplay features.",1
I really enjoy this game! I downloaded 2 and 3 because they are so much fun. Even my 8 yr old daughter has fun with these. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys the match 3 games..,1
"I love this game, and its sequel, Treasures of Montezuma 3. They are kind of the elite of match-three games. The difficulty level increases appropriately as you get more skilled, and the bonus effects that help you increase your point-earning abilities a",1
"This is a great bejeweled clone, I started playing it and soon realized I just wasted a hour and a half playing this. A good mix in difficulty with enough variety to keep you playing.",1
This game is really really fun and addictive. It has a ton of the stages. This not your basic match 3 game. Each stage has a goal and unlock new powerups the further you get. You have to get rid of a certain amount of special gems per stage and your on a,1
This is a bejeweled clone with lots of added features thats sure to keep you occupied. It's a well thought out match 3 game with puzzles to boot. An achievement badge system. Well worth the $2 after the FAOTD.Fast paced game on the Optimus V,1
Was able to play one game. Now application won't open on device. it is lost in cyberspace never never land.,0
"Great game to play when you're bored, waiting for the plane/train, in between TV shows, just before bed, or anytime, really!  The higher the level, the more difficult it is to get Montezuma to smile.  But you don't want to put it down until you do!!!",1
Have spent hours playing this one on HTC EVO. One of the most fun games I have downloaded. It appears to now work on Kindle Fire as well.Watch out for May 2013 update! Looks like all it does is push advertisements to the game menu screen (where previousl,1
I got totally addicted to this game and completed all levels.  Great way to pass the time.  Kids play it too.,1
"I don't play to many games on my cell but I love this game!! The biggest problem is that its too darn addictive, I can't put it down once I start!!!!",1
Honestly this is a genre that we don't need to continue producing. It's lame. Doesn't anyone have any originality? Barf.,0
"Yes,  this is another jewel game!  BUT it is by far the best!!  Runs great on my droid2.  Thanks amazon! and much thanks to the developer!",1
"I've had this game on my phone for a year now.  Amazingly I still find it the most entertaining Android game I've owned.  I buy them, play a couple of times, get bored, delete them.  This one is a keeper.  Perfect for waiting around in Dr.'s offices or a",1
"Out of all the &quot;match 3&quot; games, this one is my favorite. It DOES work kn the Kindle Fire, contrary to someone else's review. It always has, and that's how I've played since I bought mine in December.The game has a ton of levels, and lots of pow",1
I like the totems and bonuses. They make the game sort of unpredictable and ultimately more fun. I also like the puzzle mode. They took the gem game concept to another level with this app. Really great. Really fun.,1
"Works perfect on samsung galaxy.  Fun game, enough story to keep you interested, and nice clean graphics. 18 19 20",1
"Thought this would be another Bejeweled knockoff, but the added features are great. Was free app of the day months ago. Still enjoying it, and would buy it, if I ever needed to.",1
"I downloaded the free one at first, and I ended up downloading this one. It's always better to get the games you have to pay for, because the free ones, you end of having to pay in the long run anyway. I played one fast game on the free game, and I ended",1
"A fun game and long play time.  Worked well with Samsung Tab2.0, Pandigital Planet and would hang sometime with Pandigital Novel.",1
I really like how this game involves unlocking features such as bomb tiles and special abuilities like getting two tripplets in a row of the same color can grant you some special bonus power.  Power ups clustered in a match three game works.,1
"I picked it up as the deal of the day from Amazon, so I couldn't go wrong.  I don't know that I would have paid for it, but for a free game, it holds entertainment value.  It is very similar to all the other gem type games out there, but it is VERY addic",1
This is a wonderful game! Those who have compared it to Bejeweled are only correct in that you match the types to clear the board. But.... There is a LOT more to this game! You have to build buildings  with gold you earn by playing and earn tokens to hel,1
"I tried this game and I am glad I did. I was looking for Jewel Quest for my kindle, did not find the one I wanted, so I tried this game.It is another matching game, but the graphics are different. Tri it, I am pretty sure you will like it.",1

"Basically bejeweled Aztec style, that being said it's a fun game would def recommend. This is probably why it's been up for 2 days as AFAOTD.",1
I told her about this game being the FAOTD yesterday.  5 hours later she still hadn't set her phone down.  That allowed me to watch Breaking Bad and Storm Chasers. (both are shows she doesn't like)Auto 5 stars!,1
"Extremely fast paced and alot of fun. This game will probably replace my chuzzle addiction. If you cant get into it, delete it. dont give it a bad review. This game os pretty much excellent.",1
makes time fly fly away. couldn't believe the hours passed  by so far. would recommend to anyone who enjoys having fun.,1
I have been playing this game non stop for weeks. A very addictive variant of the classic match 3 game style. Works great on the Toshiba Thrive tablet.,1
"Awesome sound, color and over all feel.  Easy to play, great time killer, overall a great bejewled type of game. A few extra factors separate it from bejewled like earning points to buy some needed items. You won't be disappointed as long as you like col",1

"I find myself opening this app more often than just about any other game I have installed on my phone, and whenever I upgrade my phone, it's one of the first games to get reinstalled.There aren't any in app purchase requirements, a huge plus in my book! ",1
I'm hooked on this game! The ability to get upgrades to the various blocks and idols keeps me wanting to keep playing. I've actually chose this game over playing my Xbox 360 a couple times.,1
I loved this game on the computer when I played it a few years ago and its still a great game!,1
"I'm impressed by how well this works and runs on the Motorola Xoom (WiFi). It's addicting, and really attractive. A pleasure to play.Has become one of my favorite games in just a a day.",1
This is just like so many games where you match three items... but it is a fun updated version with power ups and levels. Not exactly my type of game but it can keep you entertained for a while. Works well on my Motorola Atrix 4g.,1
I never played the first one but I love this one.  It is challenging yet easy to learn.  I like the graphics and there are plenty of levels to keep you busy.  A great time killer and just plain fun.,1
This game is fun and addictive. If you don't like this I don't think you could like ANY kind of app. Once again I LOVE THIS APP.:),1
"This is a fun puzzle game, although it's very difficult to get top marks on the levels. The trick is to wait until you have some new enhancements (totems), and then go back to the older levels.",1

I played this on the PC and was pleased when I came across this for the android. Match 3 with lots of bells and whistles. Played a bunch of levels of the adventure mode and had no problems whatsoever with my Kindle Fire. Highly recommended if you like ma,1
"Hopefully solving video game puzzles is good for your brain, because this is another good entry.  I can spend hours playing.  Good graphics, sounds, and colors.  If you enjoy this kind of thing, give it a try.",1
I have several match 3 type games and this is by far my favorite!  a few new spins makes it more interesting!,1
This game is incredibly addictive. I play it every chance I get.  It is a very interesting and entertaining twist on Bejeweled and the graphics are fabulous.  Love it!,1
New variation to an old idea makes it enjoyable. Nice graphics. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play when you really don't want to be stressing the grey matter. I play it for a break from work.,1

"I consider this a waste, Don't get this, this cannot calculate this problem (.9 divide==) ans is 1.111111111.  Only get a calculator that can  do this simple problem.",0
Tried multiple times to set it up over a span of 4 days. Every single time it says there was a problem and to try again later. Tried SoundHound and it works perfectly.,0
Although I don't have a whole lot of a use for this app it is really neat and very well done. Tested it in a loud Chili's bar and it worked flawlessly.,1
"I accidentally hit the button before I was ready for it to identify the song.  I quickly tapped for it to stop listening.  With one second worth of listening, it correctly identified the tv commercial that was playing in the background.  That is pretty g",1
"It tells me that I need to do the setup step, but I just get the same error message that it didn't work and I should try again later.  It's done this for a few days, so there is some permanent issue, but the app doesn't give any more details.  SoundHound",0
same issues as others will not load past startup keeps asking to redownload from amazon appstore. Please fix with and update would Love to have the full version that would work past the startup,0
The product works very well. Have had no issues with it since i downloaded it. Very nifty when i want to figure out what song i am hearing but have to clue what it is. Thanks!!!,1
This is really great app.... I just watched a Korean movie n they were playing a Korean song.... well Shazam listened to the music n it picked the movie n Scene from the movie... wow!!,1
great app to buy. music lovers must have this! free version great but limited. it identifies songs quickly. even songs in movies and tv shows! it is awesome. enjoy!,1
Why does this app need to know my location?  Why does it load itself into the background even if I repeatedly kill the application with a force close?Shazam is yet another example of a PAID application that feels they can freely violate my privacy.  I'm ,0
"Shazam sucks, 1. it never loads quick enough and I don't get to record the song in time...2. needs lyrics(which SoundHound has).",0
Have been using this for a long time and it works like a charm. Can't imagine why so many people are having problems with this.,1
I hum or sing the same song the exact same way and soundhound is able to find it easily but shazam finds nothing! I have soundhound free andI am sticking with it. Shazam is very disappointing.,0
"Ever hear a song on radio but can't figure out the name of it or who sings it? Download this app and you won't have to feel that way anymore. You just have to hold the phone up to the music with this app open and press a button and BAM, it tells you ever",1
"I have never had any problems with this app, if you are having a hard time with this app, its probably cause your phone is outdated!",1
"Another crap app, that cant differentiate between and market and a damn OUT OF DATE amazon app. The market version is TWO REVISIONS higher than the Amazon Market.",0
I have used this from when it first came out.  I am now a &#34;Music&#34; person just when I heard something it is nice to know what it is/was.,1
"Using a Nexus S, it works great but its a little slow, found a lot of songs I thought it would never find... Rage, Skindred, Gorillaz, and even Cage the Elephant",0
"This is my favorite music identification app! I cant believe it went on a free day!  This app can do so much! It is astonishing that it can get the lyrics, youtube, and buy the song",1
It keeps giving me a connection error when trying to set up on Xoom. I have uninstall and even tried the free version from the Android Market... Still no luck.,0
Well I got a notification that I need to update well it said new permissions required so I compared them to the previous release the previous one has 9 and this new one has 14 can anyone say overkill,0
"This app is not worth 5 bucks. And on top of that,  it won't even work any more.  It tells me to redownload from the amazon market.  And pay 5 bucks when I got it for free yesterday?!  No thanks.",0
"Needs update.  Everytime I try to use it, it force closes an says I need to re dl from the market.  Hope there is a fix to this problem soon.  It seems like everyone else is having the same problem.  Evo",0
Great app for identifying music when you don't know the name or artist then you can download from an available music store.,1
This is a great upgrade from the free version. Unlimited tagging is great plus all the other features you love are here. I got it as the free app of the day but it is worth the price tag.,1
"I just got this and when I tested it, perfect! I like the feature that it can show you the lyrics. Great app. Thanks for making this!",1
"It works great, finds the songs you need and is only second to Soundhound because you can't really hum songs into it.",1
i only tried 2 tags. one on tv and another from a music clip in YouTube. it worked both times. only if i could have had this app years ago when i was recording instrumental music on cassette tapes. i has a few sings i need to know who they are.,1

For me I have had both sound hound and this app and for me this app was far better and faster at identifying songs especially in noisy conditions. sometimes identifying songs almost immediately after pushing the button. Blazing fast and highly recommende,1

"I don't know about the bad reviews. I've had this since day one and it has never let me down. I can't vouch for soundhound, don't feel I need to. Shazam never once missed a tag, from the 3 sec tv show or the car with the windows open.",1
Hasn't missed a song yet. Even picking up some indie rock. And it automatically keeps a record so you can go back later and see which songs you listened to that day to download.,1
This app has never ceased to amaze me when I'm trying to figure out a song and I have my phone handy. Great app!,1
Works every time. Always gets the song right. Then I can watch it on youtube or share it on Facebook or buy the mp3 from Amazon. Pretty sick.,1
"if you can't get it to install, DON'T LEAVE A BAD RATING. that's more your problem than the developers. mine installed flawlessly. -Nexus S 2.3.3",1
"I've been using Shazam since I first got an Android phone (April 2010) and it's always been my go to app when I need music identified.  For the most part it's incredibly accurate, but once you start trying to identify more obscure artists you'll start hi",1
What a great application! Works great on my EVO 4g and because I listen to music all the time this will come in extremely handy. Thanks amazon for the unlimited version for free.,1
The future is now. It never got anything on the radio wrong. Even remixes. An app that can make my doctorate in DJ-ing and my masters in music recognition seem like a waste of time? It's the apocalypse alright.,1
"I was originally going to give this app 5 stars, but now that I keep getting the Amazon Appstore: unknown error message and it keeps force closing.. I have to igve it 1 star.. please fix this..",0

I've been meaning to buy Shazam Encore for a while now. This version is ad-free and includes unlimited tagging. Don't forget that any app with ads can send certain information about you to advertisers.Shazam is a wonderfully useful app that you can whip ,1

Was amazed when I went to start of a random reggae song and it guessed it from just the start of a melody. Impressive! And you can do so much from watch YouTube video or listen on Pandora from the results!,0
Works great with my atrix( root). I haven't have any issues with the app. The app does an awesome job and is free. 25 word minimun really Amazon?,1
are no longer a problem with this app.  I love shazam.  works like a charm.  have yet to find a song it did not recognize.,1
im really happy that amazon made this app free for a day cuz I was really fed up with the free version. it works very well and I'm surprised it has only an average of 3 stars,1
I also have a spotify account so it's nice that there's integration there.  Or I just get them from the amazon store.,1
Great app for identifying music! UI is also very nice and simple to use.A definite &#34;must have&#34; for music lovers!,1
if you are like me and you love music but don't always know the name of the song or the artist this is the perfect app.  it will tell you all you need to know about the song and how to get it.  Love this and use it all the time.,1

I downloaded zedge and it changes my ringtone. Plus I haven't been Able to use the ringtones.  It defaults to something else. I took it to the Verizon store twice and it still defaults to a different ringtone.,0

i had this app and everything was fine until i found out that there were tweets i wasn't sending. they were about weight loss and i uninstalled this app and changed my password and it stopped. I'm still unsure but it may have hacked my twitter BIATCH,0
"I don't personally tweet a lot and that's mainly my fault because I haven't learned the system yet.  I do follow my family and it's a fun way to hear what my boys are up to.  They know I'm not adept at the system, but they leave messages for me to read b",1

"I love twitter, it is a wonderful site, to communicate facts, feelings  and fiction! LOLYour followers keep an 'open mind' about details &/or personal feelings",1

I have not yet learned how to use this app or ignore it either as it keeps coming up on my tablet when I don't ask for it. I may have to remove it soon as it does annoy me. The 5 stars are because it looks as if it will work well for some folks.,1

"It works like a charm, just like the other Twitter apps which we weren't expecting since some of the Kindle apps are full bugs. Pleasantly surprised.",1
It's a little different format from the one used in iOS. I actually prefer this one over the iOS version. It just feels cleaner and faster. I can easily navigate between sections and it doesn't take much time at all to load new tweets.,1

"I use this more than the website because it's easier to scroll through the feed than on my computer.  The feed stays where I left it, and since I follow a lot of people, it's very helpful in keeping track of what I've seen.  This app is also fully functi",1
easy to access. Excellent App. Easy to use and access is rapid. Links are supported with no problem. One of the best apps to date.,1
If you use Twitter than you almost have to get it for any mobile device you own. It's nice to have a front row seat into the lives of people you may never get to meet.,1

"I am definitely tweeting more since I downloaded this app!! That's saying something because I thought Twitter was ridiculous now I m tweeting away. Chirp, chirp.",1
I don't really use Twitter but my nieces really like to use it so for that reason I will give it 1 star!,0
I have a few people I like and I follow them and enjoy reading what's going on in their world sometimes.,1
but generally a waste of time.  I find little of relevance to my daily life and I'm discerning in who/what I follow.  Bothered by intrusions from those in whom I have NO interest.,0
I like twitter and this app is easy to use and helpful. Easy to keep up with things in life,1
Have no complaints with this application so far. This is the social media I prefer to use so I am hoping the smooth operating continues.,1
Works wonderfully. It is way better than any other Twitter app I've seen to date. It's smooth and easy to use. Love it.,1

I could never sign in after I set up my account and posted my first tweet.  It kept sending me to the browser to sign in because it said that my account was suspended.  I tried to sign in in the browser but the security words that it wants you to type in,0
I read it everyday and have no problem with it at all.  But haven't read any for awhile due to lack of time but will resume it soon.  But it is really great to have it on Kindle Fire and easier than iPhone which is much smaller and sometimes hard to read,1
"This app is great. You get to share your news with people, without the intrusive privacy invasions that facebook has recently become. A+ app.",1

I love twitter I have met many new bands and have met many new directioners a I get updates on yours and just about everything,1
Love to use this app. 140 characters or less to state your option. Good to talk about many issues from Breakfast to Immigration. Can even use it ti share pictures of your food.,1
Twitter good ole Twitter it's got everything it's just Twitter on your kindle you get what you expect. If you like Twitter get this app,1
"Twitter is awesome and it works especially great on the kindle fire. I'm on it all the time &amp; sometimes it freezes up but I think that's just my Kindle, not the app. I say get it!!!!!",1
this app does not work well for me. It can barley function and when ever I press on one thing-  it does the opposite.  honestly I do not think you should get this app.,0
"I'm using this to save all of my dates. I always have my Kindle with me, so it's readily available. I like that I can just write with my finger or an electronic stylus rather than typing with the little pop-up qwerty. Less typo's and auto-corrects that w",1
This app helps me when I cannot find a pen...I can just jot down it on here and transfer to my calendar when I get home!!,1
I love this app.  IT the easiest calendar to use. thank you.  ICan easily check it everyday and not miss anymore appointments.,1
Well I was optimistic but I really like it. You can write notes and make it your own. All you have to do is swipe to your right to go to the next month and swipe up to go to the next year over all I love it. they could add more Colors but it's a good app,1

you wake up and have your day's plan at the tip of your fingers. You will find this app at as a very good planner.,1
I like this app but too much porn ads.I'm a child knowing about porn .it said porn on the ad.,1
This app is pretty much as basic as it gets. I downloaded it for my fire. You can add memos but not much else. I'll keep it until I find one with better functionality.,0
It's not easy to since with email. I would like to use it but since it will not since with my email I can't.,0
"i have been searching for a plain calendar app for free and not one was good. this one is perfect, and simple for my kindle fire.",1
Have several and like them all for various reasons and they are so handy to have right at your fingertips.,1
This app is awesome. It helps me soo much for my daily planning and memos. It helps me get really organized! I would recommend this app. You should get it. I hope my review helped. :),1
This was confusing to use and I simply deleted it rather than fight with it. Often it wouldn't load at all.,0
I like this calendar app.  It is easy to use with the keyboard or handwriting.  Great app to have handy.,1
"This program works excellent on my Kindle Fire, and ""syncs"" nicely with my Google Calendar.  Don't waste your time on the free ones!",1
too hard to use. it was fun to play with but I need to get the business done when shopping,0
After I figured how to use it with the icons and reminders it was great. Its the only calender I use now.,1
"I thought this app would be great, but heck no!!! its so cofuzing and you cant type anything, I wouldn't ever tell a friend about this!!!:( disappointing",0
"It was free.  What more can I say, there are others that are much better.  Needless to say I use another calender now.",0
Installed and uninstalled.  Needs a lot of work and fixs. Hope the developer will take the time to improve on a good base of a program.,0
This is a great app to become more organized. It was really a huge help during high school soccer season and will be more helpful during cheer season! YaY!!!,1
I like this app a lot and its free.  I like to jot down notes sometime to remind to do stuff. It works well with my stylus pen and Kindle Fire. I would recommend this app to others.,1
"I downloaded this calendar to my Kindle Fire. You use your finger to write memos to the calendar after touching the applicable date on the calendar. To go to the next month, slide your finger across the screen. However, I could not find a way to type a d",0
Hated it downloaded because its free deleted it just as fast dont waste your time there are better apps out there.,0
Ads aren't too bad. That quick finger note is not very accurate but works well. Nice quick finger note. Short learning curve - but you need to test.,1
never buy another ringtone again! this app uses the songs already on your phone to allow you to make a custom ringtone from any part of any song. i always hate how the ringtones you buy cut off at weird spots or they never have the best part of the song.,1
This music maker is very simple to work.  You just need music on smart phone or maybe any cell phone and it will make a ringtone a couple of simple move.,1
That was total junk. Never even ended up using it and I sure wouldn't recommend it. Nothing but a waste of time for me.,0
"You can click on any music in your music file on your SD carrd, and pull it into the ringtone maker program. Cut it where you want and then save it as your main ringtone or attach it as the ringtone for a friend. Perfect!",1
Lots of fun making my own ringtones from favorite songs that I have downloaded to my new Galaxy II S. Not hard figuring out the controls. I esp. like being able to clip any part of a song and choosing how many seconds it runs for. You can be very precise,1
I first tried mp3 cutter and ringtone maker!! and was unable to make a single ringtone because it continuously crashed. Then I tried Ringtone Maker and it worked perfectly. It is very easy to use and very fun making and assigning ringtones. LG Optimus G ,1
Best ringtone creator/assigner I've managed to find yet. Does almost everything I need it to. Assigning individual txt tones would be nice...,1
"Why would this app need permission to access protected storage areas of memory,  read and modify contacts,  check network connections.  Way too much access for a simple utility program,  no way I'm installing this app.",0
"I don't know if it was me or the app, but lets just say for posterity's sake, it's not you its me.",0
"I really like this app  Like many apps, it will not let you choose the directory or what you want to do with it.  If it is in the alert directory, then it must be an alert right?So, it works well and I have had a lot of fun with it.  Would love to be abl",1

"For some reason, only about 1/4 of my songs on my SD card actually show up in the search. I also wasn't able to get it to make one I did find into a ringtone. It did the preview, but never saved it as a ringtone. I have an LG spectrum. It did work for so",0
"I love this easy to use app that helps you customize your ring tone.  I get frustrated when I really like a song, and there is a long musical intro at the beginning of the song. Traditionally on most phones you have to use the ring tone from the beginnin",1
"This app is absolutely fantastic. The app does exactly what I want it to do without any lagging or crashing. Honestly I thought this was going to be another piece of junk, but it works perfectly. I really didn't like the notifications my Kindle Fire came",1
"There's always a question of function when related to the Kindle Fire HD. I was pleased to find there are no issues here. This application delivers what it claims. There doesn't seem to be any bugs as I've ran it. It does sport ads, but they're tolerable",1
I have a lot of fun creating my ringtones from music on my phone with this app. I can make my ringtone as long or short as I want. I can pick just a chorus or verse from a song or a spot in a classical music sequence. Love this app,1
Really easy to use and understand.  Doesn't take a brainiac to make your own ringtones out of any downloaded music.  Quick too.,1
"Knowing that I have a phone that cannot register multiple touches that well (and most other ringtone maker apps rely on it), I love it to death. Does exactly what it says and does it well. Keep up the great work!",1
I got this so that I could use my music on my sd card for alarms and ringtones on new phone.  It didn't work for me.  No instructions and I couldn't get my rings off file. Glad it was free.,0
This app is easy and fun...make clips of music so that its the part of the song that you want by dragging the bars...simple and fun.,1
So so so easy to use to make your own ringtones or other notifications.  Once I got started I ended up making more ringtones than I needed just because it was so fun to use my own music and clip out the snippets I wanted.,1
"Start and stop your ringtone melody wherever you want, then save it. Magnifying the waveform helps pinpoint the exact place you want at the beginning and end. Other reviewers give more details, so I'll just add that I like this app and give it 5 stars.",1
Love this app w what ever song you have on your phone it will tack and you tell it where you want your ringer to start and stop in the song I have get this for 2 phones and would g stir agin,1
This is by far the best app I have downloaded yet. It says what it does and it performs great. It is easy to operate and best of all you can make any sound file your ringtone and edit any song to exactly the ringtone you want!,1
I love that I can take any song and choose any part of the song to cut for my ringtone. You simply play the song of your choice thru this app and take the bars on either side and slide them to what you want to be the beginning and end of your ring tone. ,1

Junk. Doesn't let you see the image but a second. Gameplay of ok though. Image updates would be nice too.,0

Works perfectly on my DroidX.  Used it on my local course which was listed on the courses available (that surprised my a little).,1
I've had this app for over a year at this version. Their web site says they are at version 1.8 (or 2.0..... Hard to tell). I sent an inquiry asking how to upgrade and they told me to buy it from the play store since they can't update it on Amazon. How's ,0

"Don't bother even downloading unless you're a golfer. It does nothing useful off the course. That being said, I can't wait to try this nifty little app out next time I get time to play a few holes!",1
Actually bought this from Google market expecting it to be better than Free Caddie. Almost no courses in Michigan have I found. Stunning considering the number of golf courses per acre here. The web interface to map your own is horrible. It won't use you,0

This reminds me of a bridge builder game that I had with my students. I recommend this game for anyone who likes structural engineering. Good that it also the free app of the day.,1

"Unfortunately one star is lowest I can give. What a waste of an app.  No real value,  not the slightest bit entertaining except to those who are 2 years old. With Amazon's special offer to get this for free in feel I spent too much.",0

Had this app last year when we went to Montana on AmTrak.  Had a lot of fun with it when kids were around. Some haters on here just don't get it!  Chill!!,1
If talking to inadamint objects is your thing this app is for you. Slightly more entertaining than watching paint dry. How this app is so popular on market is beyond me.,0
My 5 year old love these apps. It does exactly what the review states. Obviously the people who gave this 1 star didn't read the review and don't have kids. You can also try out the free version to see whether or not you want to buy this app.,1

All it does is repeat what you say to it with a different voice. You can also punch and slap the cat around. So if you have anger issues or you are 2yrs old then this app might be for you.Not hating on just this app. Any app like this one is just as bad.,0
"This is the cutest little guy.  He mimics you and purrs, and a few other cute things.  What a pet, no veterinary bills and no grocery bills.  This little buddy is a great companion anytime.",1
Stupid. Don't waste you're time. This app is not worth a dime. Almost insulting that they charge for this garbage. Not even worth it for free.,0

"OMG!!!!! You have got to get this app!! It is totally awesome and fun for children!!  My 6 year old boy loves it!  You can record messages and play them (ie: Happy Birthday) and the cat in his cute cartoon voice, says it back!! AWESOME! :)",1
I don't understand why anyone would buy this app.  It's almost a waste of my phone's memory. Poke and speak to the cat which will repeat in an odd voice. Fun for 10 seconds.,0
"Anyone who thinks this is a pointless app obviously does not have a 4 year old. My son loves this and laughs hysterically at it. It gets old after awhile but is worth it while it lasts. Of all the talking-something apps, this one is the best. Large file ",1

"the fart works, but it does not repeat anything i say.  sucks real bad.  deleted 5 minutes after downloading the free paid version.not worth it for free, so do not buy.",0
I really don't understand the point of this app. For something that costs money it should have a lot more functionality. There's a definite lack of creativity.,0

Tom the Talking cat he is very cool my grandkids love playing with him and the things he can do,1
I didn't even bother to download this app because the reviews were so poor. Come on Amazon. I look forward to the free apps you're offering and now I have to wait another day for the next one which will hopefully not let me down like this one. Thanks.,0

yes this app doesn't really worth a penny and I don't know why there is over 250k people downloaded it on android market. what is the point of having some more animation with this paid version?,0
My kids have loved Tom and many of his friends who have similar apps for months. I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from people who are upset that the free app of the day is targeted towards little kids. It's not the app's fault that Amazon,1

"Most negative reviews are based of anti-flash, Steve job worshipping blogs. AIR allows developers to distribute their app on multiple devices such as Android, iOS, Desktop and TV. This not lazy but efficient development.",1
What can you say about Adobe Air except that it is required to view some things and I had to download it.,1
"Adobe Air is not really an app but, rather, an operating environment kinda like Flash or Java or a number of different requirements. It does what it is supposed to do: allow Air apps to operate on your Android.  Cool!!",1
Works very well with Huawei Ascend II. Adobe is a well recognized name & always delivers top quality products that you can depend on. Very satisfied.,1
I just deleted this once I got it.  Did not like it or understand it also.  It is up to you to decide what you want to do with it.,0
"Why are people hating on Adobe?  I'd like to see more use of AIR.  It does it's job, just like JRE.  iPhone users are just jealous...",1
I like adobe and have used it many times. It's good for so many of the apps you have installed.  It loaded great for me and you definitely need it.,1

As soon as I installed it on my phone all my other apps starting acting buggy. I'm not sure what this app does but I thought it would make my Flash dependent apps work better. No so! I uninstalled very quickly to restore the stableness of my phone.,0

The wife couldn't figure this out at first but it's an easy download (in my opinion) and was required to view her books. She loves it now.,1

Will not load on my kindle hdx and it is required for one of the games I loaded. I cannot play a game I paid for due to this problem.,0

Stupid game. Waste of time. Wish would never down loaded it. absolutely the worst I ever down loaded What were you thinking?,0
I can trust time more then I can trust any of my other friends. He does not ask to borrow money and not pay it back. He does not borrow things and not bring it back. Last but not least he won't talk shut about you behind your back,1

Laughter is the best medicine and it makes me laugh when he repeats my words.  Sometimes he might miss some though.,1
you need to download so many different things to play this game its not that great really you r wasting your time with this one,0
who could ask for more?  This is a silly app and I don't really understand it but everyone in my house thinks it's so funny.  I see everyone (including the adults) playing with it.,1
This might entertain a three year old for a few minutes but even that's pushing it. The 'free' version is crippled beyond belief.  You're expected to pay for almost every feature. Don't waste your time.,0
I love when u talk to him and he's like a translator so please please please buy talking Tom the cat,1
this is kinda funny to play with. what more can be said download it play it if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things),1

"DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL, IT ONLY DOES A FEW THINGS IF YOU WANT MORE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT",0
There aren't enough nice things that you can do with this cat. You can make it purr a little but mostly its geared toward punching and hurting the cat. The interaction is too violent and promotes laughing at hurting an animal. Disgusting.,0

"Just a way to sell you add-ons. I suppose it could be considered cute, (Ben the dog is better)But it is a thinly disguised vending machine for in-app purchases.",0
This is so much fun the whole family can enjoy. The kids get the most out of it when he repeats what they say.,1
I love my talking Tom cat. My son has it & i found it very funny. Lots of laughs & lots of fun!,1
I love this cat! He has the cutest voice! I use this app to wake my son up in the morning. Just talk into your kindle and tom repeats whatever u say but in a way cuter voice.,1
This application was very laggy and very slow. The cat would move it's mouth with a delay of a few seconds for any words.,0
I play this with my grandkids and I don.t know who enjoys it more! It just makes you laugh. There is no thinking required.,1
This is such a cute app.  I could hardly get my phone out of my grandson's hands because he had so much fun with it.  It's fun for adults too.,1
This  app  is  the  worst  I've  ever  downloaded  it  stinks. It  is  so  boring  all  you  can  do is  tap  things.,0
Doesn't work that great on my Kindle fire. What a bummer as my young kids get a laugh out of it.,0
"When u need to break tension or make the kids laugh this is great, really like it when children smile and laugh",1
Tom cat is very funny & entertaining. You will keep the attention of any crowd. This can be used for all ages.,1
Talking Tom is better than the other apps. He's been a brilliant idea of a game. This free download has  hilarious cat.,1
Not worth the time loading....can't do anything but make the cat purr and knock him out. I would recommend you pay for this one so he will do more than two things. I was disappointed.,0
I have seen other people have this and it's as funny as can be.. but it didn't work on my KindleFire HD.. nothing! at least it was free.,0
It's great what I really like is how you can make videos and upload it to anything I uploaded my first one,1
I love the app but I am not sure if I like the original one or the 2nd one! So please comment me on witch one you think is better!,1
TALKING TOM WILL NOT DOWNLOAD ON MY KINDLE FIRE DEVICE. MY DAUGHTER HAS IT ON HER I PHONE AND I THOUGHT IT TO BE VERY FUNNY.,0

doesn't do that much...amusing for the first minute or so.  I will probably delete this app in another week or so.,0

Just a fun app to play around with and pass time - it is just fun and funny-I like it,1
Fun and cute for my daughter! Good for young ages! I believe K thru 2nd graders would love this Tom Cat!,1
Always fun to go back to this guy once in awhile.  Him and his friend apps are always there for a silly laugh with friends from time to time.,1
My two year old loves this! It doesn't get old for her and we share lots of laughs over it. It does just what is described. She loves knocking the cat down. It is helping her learn to talk as well!,1
"It's fun, grandkids love it.  He s cute, like all the different things he does.  Entertaining and they get a good laugh out of him.",1
This app is for my granddaughter and she loves to play with and really make her laugh when she is playing with it.,1
it's very fun and good. super fun to record and play with when bored. this is super great love it!!,1
It is so much fun to see this cat talking and complaining when you touch it is great.  It gives the impression that is real.,1

Amazon should mention that this app will not talk on the Kindle Fire.  I looked like an idiot talking to my Kindle expecting a response.  I will be deleting this app.,0
Most annoying app ever.  I can't believe I actually even downloaded this.  As soon as I opened it and used it once I deleted it.,0
It is hilarious!  My grandkids and nieces love it! Very entertaining!I would recommend this app to anyone with small or not so small kids!,1

Enjoy myself and great for grandchildren who thoroughly enjoy it!,1

This app works great!  I use it to entertain my three yr old.  He loves it!  He has even figured out how to make videos with it.,1
I didn't feel it was appropriate for my children. Some of the things were ok but others werent. I have deleted it.,0
this app is cute and funny. all my friend's laugh and thought it was cute. it's a good conversation app to get.,1
How cute this is.  This cat talks to you and he is funny.  He purrs and does all kind of funny things.  Nice when you need a cute laugh.  Easy to operate and has a kids mode and adult mode.,1
"Love showing my friends and family this app. Just like me they all got a kick out of it. Especially when I came across buying a lifelike talking Tom through Avon, as an Avon rep.",1
"I just got the Talking Tom Cat app.  This is the cutest little cat and when he repeats what I said to him, my real life cats come running over if I say their name and then he repeats it!",1
what can I say....another talking adorable animal and this one is my favorite for sure...You talk and he repeats what you say in a funny voice...he's HILARIUS...My favorite..,1
fun for the whole family. The cat repeats everything you say and the hubby & kids have a blast with this app,1
I think it's great so much fun. My mom has it on her phone too. I have so much fun on it. It is fun for everyone.,1
Bests kids app ever a little annoying but F-U-N fun you need to buy this app I love it tom ( the cat ) is so funny he says what you say you can step on his toe punch him pull his tail and much much more he makes me LOL best:),1
I'm an animal lover so I love this app because it sends little messages at top of the phone like &#34; hey come play with me&#34; lol but it's boring at times . I wish they could make it where Tom does more than being in the house,1
this app is too funny. having lots of fun with it and other people. everyone needs to laugh. buy this app for some laughs.,1
This game is entertaining! My cousin (2 yrs old) loves to play it and is obsessed with the kitty :3 good for kids and up.,1
This is my favorite app to use for navigating and editing files on my Android phone. I highly recommend this app to anyone who appreciates good utilities made with integrity. I have not found 1 bug while heavily using this app for many years.,1
"This is certainly the gold standard for an effective app.  The UI is not beautiful, but it is not clunky and cluttered either.If the dev was aiming for an uber-functional and flawless app that simply does what it should and does it perfectly, he hit his ",1
This handy app really gets to the Root of the issue especially if you have bloated apps that take up valuable resource and space. Bear in mind you do need to be Root to benefit from this app!,1
"Excellent file manager app! Even the free version is great, and all you need if not rooted!",1
"Must have, only way to truly customize your phone and use all of the accessible storage space on the internal memory.Best money I hand spent on a app",1
very good so much,1
Awesome app. I use it a lot. Root is very useful and this app can be used for so many things. Even if u aren't rooted yet this is a good file manager to use. In most cases you can browse the root of your phone and even copy from but not delete the files ,1
"This is the very best root file manager with a very clean ui and tons of essential features, i would recommend this app to anyone. I also recommend getting this devs app &quot;SQLite&quot;, its another must have app:)",1
How can you rate something that won't download!!won' t even let you rate it  I want my money back! what else do I have to say expect that it does not even rate one star if you can't even down load it. oh did i say i tried about twenty times over the cour,0
Very versatile and fast - the best for Android I've seen so far. A strong recommendation for gettings this app if your device is rooted and you need a solid file manager.,1
"This is the best application for navigating, modifying, and organizing your rooted Android device. Solid performance with a familiar interface.",1
If you want access to the file system on your android device this is it.  I am using it on my kindle and it is awesome.,1
"I have this tool on both my Nook Color &amp; Galaxy Tab.  You need this for all those little tweets to keep your rooted device running smooth.  I found that there is a small learning curve, but once learned you can&apos;t live without it.",1
I needed this to install the supposedly pre-installed Google Store/Google Play that my tablet shipped with.  Works well and has yet to disappoint.,1
"Having this app already, I must say that this app should come with every Android phone. Easy to use interface and straight to the point. 5/5 stars!",1
Anyone with a rooted phone will find this is the most awesome file manager out there. You can even see and edit the contents of a database file. Keep up the good work!,1
I use this on my Kindle to get around Amazon's stupid restrictions. It works really great and has allowed me to access the Google Play Store and actually get some good apps (unlike Amazon's... yikes).,1
Most useful app I've purchased so far. If you want to get the most out of your Android phone then this is a must have after you obtain root for your phone. Simple and intuitive to use. Thanks to the dev for putting this up on Amazon. Saves us Google Apps,1
"A must have for root users, AND for those who choose not to root as well. By far the very best file explorer! More options and flexibility than all others available, and I have tried them all over the last 6 years of using and rooting Android phones and ",1

"I guess it's for a more experienced user, but I couldn't figure out how to even make the drop box work.  I deleted the app after some frustration.",0
"I'm sorry, but I think this app is leaving out the part ROOT which is in its stupid NAME!!!! At least I THINK that rooting isn't possible on this app, but personally, I think you need to be rocket scientist to figure out how yo work this app.Well, that's",0
This is a very good file manager. This is probably one of a kind wrt handling of viewing and editing DB entries directly.,1
"I used this to help move files from my computer to my bionic. I ran into some problems after uninstalling yahoo from my phone, which I found is required for contacts to work. I used root explorer to help put those files back where I needed them to be. Ph",1
I installed this app specifically because it supports Google drive but none of my files populate. Drop box works fine but Google drive Stays blank. Very disappointed.,0
"This is easily one of my favorite Apps on my phone, I use it just about every day, I don&apos;t know what I would do without it...",1
"This may not be the best UI file manager, but when I try other tools I always come back. I've used it forever across different devices and several versions of Android OS. It always worked well, and had the fleibility to do whatever I needed. If you are n",1
"Having my phone flashed with CyanogenMod, I bought this app. With it, I'm able to write sound files to the internal memory for ringtones. Sure you can do it on the SD card, but when the SD card is mounted, the sound files cannot be read for obvious reaso",1
"I don&apos;t know what that guy was talking about, but both products on the market are the same version. And how can you NOT purchase this! Get it if you&apos;re root. Great sale.",1
Fun in the car!,1

It is so fun I love it I could play it all day but on a rainey day I would.,1
"I can only believe that the reason ANYONE could possibly give this more than one star is because they have never played the Android or iPhone and even iPad version, which has been available for over 5 years now on iPhone. To label this as HD is false adv",0

It's nothing like when you play with you family! Just play real UNO! Don't get this app! If you get this app I will find you and uninstall every single app you own! Just kiddin'. But seriously don't get this app.,0

"If you grew up enjoying UNO then you'll enjoy the time it takes to play the game. It's sort of like Monopoly; it's not over very quickly! But, like I said, stick to it and have some good times. When you get tired of all the copy-cat games, fall back to U",1

another excellent card game on the kindle HD. highly recommend to all the card players.  an older game that keeps coming back for more.,1
When you get a plus 4 wild card I am never sure whether to challenge or not -- what is it that makes the challenge successful as opposed to failing and having to take 6 cards!,1
I purchaced this app as a family game to find it needed extra memory than what it needed at installation. Very disappointed with this app. I don't recommend installing.,0
my 9 year old and 6 year old like to play this on the kindle fire. my 6 yr old likes it more. glad i purchased it. tons of fun.,1
Do not get this on kindle fire. I just got it and it downloaded. it will not open.it said that it is not compatible. DO NOT GET THIS APP. I WANT A REFUND NOW!,0

UNO is a fun game to play on my kindle. UNO is not a difficult game. Children and adults can play UNO.,1
"So I got this app on my kindle fire,and does not even work. Every time I try to download the extra information it does not work!!!",0
I;ve akways enjoyed playing UNO (the card game) with my grandsons.  They really get competitive and I always lose to them.  This new app is a lot better because you can play 1 to 4 people.  It's nice having the app know the rules - grandsons make them up,1
"I KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME,  BUT THE STUPID APP SEEMS TO HAVE A MIND OF ITS OWN. IT WILL NOT SHOW ME ALL MY CARDS AND WHEN I TRY TO MOVE THE CARDS BLOCKING (SOMETIMES MORE THAN HALF THE HAND)  THEY WILL NOT MOVE OR IT PICKS A CARD AND PLAYS IT,  AND SO",0

This is an old school game that will never go out of style. I always loved this and play it all the time.,1
"What can I say, UNO is UNO!!  It is a great classic game!!! I love it, my grand's love it!!!",1
I have had no problems with this on my kindle fire.  actually I think its quite fun!! maybe the old version was bad?? This one is well worth the 99&cent; for it!!! Try the tournament for some crazy fun! Two thumbs up for the kindle fire version!!!,1
"My grandkids wanted to play this game while visiting, so we downloaded the app.  I have not used it since so cannot comment on it personally.  I don't use it and plan to delete it.",0

"I LOVE IT, IT'S NOT A GAME REALLY, IT'S A REFERENCE IT TEACHES YOU THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW OR HAVE FORGOTTEN.",1
I find it keeps me on my toes.  I have been challenged by trying to remember location of scriptures and if I remember details of events.  Anyone who wants to study the Bible should use this app.,1
"Love any program that helps one to learn more about God's word.  This is a good activity to use  in free time with Bible students, as a quiz,  a fun activity with friends or just to see how much you know about the scriptures in the Bible.",1
"The amazing part is that it takes you directly to the passage when you select the correct answer.The best, my employers are Christian and they love it too.  Hours of fun and education.  A must buy.",1

My 2 year old granddaughter really enjoys this app! It is a nice app for the little ones and provides a good amount of learning( I learned some sounds I didn't know).  I highly recommend this app for 1 + 2 year olds - it keeps them busy,1

This is on my kindle fire I use it when Pandora was only allowing certain amounts of free listening a month. Great for exploring your music taste finding new bands you may like and the ads are less annoying than the ones on Pandora,1
I find this app fits my moods better.  The variety has been really nice to chose from and listen to.,1
I can understand a commercial every few songs for the free version but increasing commercial counts is annoying when you hear the same ones over and over. The new update plays 2 commercials in a row after 2 songs played. This app is temperamental with th,0

"this app is decent, i'd reccomend over Pandora, doesn't buffer as much as Pandora. of course its sometimes a lil laggy when only on a 3g coverage but no where near as bad as Pandora or other competitors",1
THIS  is not what I was thinking it was. I did read about it. I was mislead...not because of the AMAZON review.,0

Awesome app !! It came on my TB and I tried it out. It's awesome. I love it that I can listen to different genre's of music. Whatever I'm in the mood for. The best feature is the fact if I don't like or want to listen to a song I can skip it.,1
This is my favorite internet radio. This has way better selection of music than Pandora and iHeartradio combined! I love the variety of songs they play and customization. You should definitely download it.,1
I bought a radio latly and thaught that I needed music because Pandora is annoying sometimes I looked and asked my friends and slacker was the top Fav. out of all I reccomend this to music lover!,1

I use to listen to pandora until I was turned on to slacker. I work at gym and the radio plays the same 24 hr rock blocks every day. Slacker mixes it up and songs that I or members do not like I can skip past.,1
App works well on my kindle fire. I wish it was a little more &#34;fine tune-able&#34; rather than just radio stations but nice app all the same.,1

its fun at first but then it gets super boring. its really easy too it ttakkes no skill at all. if you're good at tilting the screen then you'll be fine.,0
Played for a total of 2 minutes. I can't see how it could of gotten 3 stars. It is not worth downloading even as a free app.,0
wone tim I wus lik haveig a talnt sho an this musician lik did a magik trik lik with eggs I likd him butt he died cus he didn't win cus,0
"whenever I'm bord I play this game iv gone to level 275 already Iv played it for 4 months already but its your decision,id get it",1
"This game is slow to respond and boring, and had an ad I would not want my children to see, so I installed it in record time.",0
whoever rates this 1 star didn't read the descry dug it never ends you idiot and my 2 year old sis loves to play this thanks for making the great app!,1
"Best game EVER!!! Ya know, when i started it, i didnt know how to play and was like DELETE! But i  figured it out, and i loved it! Great job Team 5 Soft.",1
Sorry but this game is a real bust. It doesn't even qualify being called a game. A game should at least be fun and/or challenging. This is neither&hellip; plus it's really poor quality.,0
"Basically you need to make sure the little ball doesn't reach the top.  It is fun, and easy for my 3 year old.  he doesn't get frustrated with it.  We put the settings so that he can tilt the kindle fire instead of touching the sides.",1
"There's always something to say about keeping things simple. However, this time it's not a good thing.This game is so basic that it gets very old very fast. It doesn't help either that the world always scrolls by at the same rate, and the score creeps up",0
"Yes,I have this app and it's sooo fun :D It does work..I played it hundreds of times,it is so addicting.Oh and btw its FREE people...GET IT :P",1

"This a very fun game to pull out when you're bored. To be redundant, it is extremely addictive. I absolutely love fall down. :) I have to keep it from my friends or I won't get my kindle back for hours.",1
pretty fun app free an only &frac12; a megabyte.was is not to like!thank you for reading this review!!,1
I'm addictedto this game and all y'all haters are trippin! y'all can find some other game to rate bad cuz this game is funnnnn! I love it!,1
Now this one will make people think you are nuts! ever wonder what every one is doing when they are holding their android app things up and tilting them side to side/ Well now you know! Keep the ball from getting crushed at the top...and the more you get,1
I really suggest you getting this game it is really fun even though you just tilt back. And fourth it is just really fun. DOWNLOAD AND PLAY NOW!!!!!!!!!,1
I have this game on my ipod touch and when I saw it on kindle I was so excited!!! I love it!! please get!!,1
It is a very bad game. Only fun if your soooo bored that you are desperate. Probably more for little kids less for older kids and adults. They didn't make it very good. Presents no challenge.,0
if you have nothing nice te type don't type anything at all you meanies why did you get this app if you said it was boring you should have read the thing that tells you about the app then you should decide and forget about the app and reviews if you revi,1
all it does is you tilt your device and make a round ball.go down lower and lower.until you go over the screen.Do NOT BUY. WASTE OF TIME,0
I agree that this game goes on and on. however this is a very very very very very very very very very very very fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :):):);););):0:0:0;0;0;0,1
Okay I just want to start off saying if anyone wants to waste time being bored this is the game for you and further more I want rather watch a snail snug along than play this game in the first 30-40 seconds I realized that I was more bored playing the ga,0
My granddaughter got me hooked on this game...It is so much fun and a challenge. It is really helping my grandson with his co-ordination.  Great game and a lot of fun.,1
"No thought about it it is  addictive but the skills it takes to get 200points is amazing.  I recommended this game for people who like addicting,fun,  and cool games you might also reconise those game for the i phone 4.  ENJOY!!!!",1
"This App was fair, and my children enjoyed the games and the endless hours of fun. Easy for everyone to play and understand",1
omg i thought the game was boring at fist but then it gets really fun. its a great game to play when you are sitting in the car without Internet. hope my review helped. but seriously get this game.,1
the only reason its given all stars because.......u have to understand the sequence of events of game culture.So do not tease about this sad game........GIVE IT FREDOM!,1
First of all it was free just alot of time was wasted installing and uninstalling the controls are terrible I played it for 1 round and then uninstalled it one word of advice DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP!!,0
"I tried this game also and played it a few times. I think this and the Falldown 2 Classic could become addicting. It is challenging so try it. It was free, if you don't like it you can always deletel",1
This app is a lot of fun. You half to tilt your device quick so the ball will keep falling. I highly recommend this app.,1
this game is not worth it. the game itself is boring and not addicting at all. don't wast ur time downloading this app.,0
i have a kindel fire and this game dosent give me any problems. i love this game. its addicting. i play it all the time with no problem,1
I downloaded it to my kindlle fire and it completely didn't work it didn't seem that fun though. it was also hard to remove from my kindle,0
I was hooked after the first try. I kept playing over and over again trying to beat my previous score. Great game.,1
Really enjoyable game takes little effort and can get challenging. Its even free so you cant say anything bad about that.,1
this game is so boring all you do is guide the ball were you want it to it is so belong I advise you not to get this ap. if you get this apyou will be bored forever and you will delete it from your device right away.,0
so I downloaded this game and it is nothing like the picture. I thought it would be like that but I guess I was wrong.,0
its a good game dont lissen to all those other freaks thet say it doesent work on kindle fire its great,1
I love it is a great game but some levels are really hard I think you should get it it is fun.,1
I don't like how u just go back and forth!!! its so boring and it goes on and on I don't think it will ever end!!!! also its so touchy when u tilt it it goes so extreme and messes u up!!!,0
"Falldown is perhaps , next to Drag Toilet Paper, the best representative sample of the types of games available  in a watered down software repository.  It is not something to be sought after ,  nor is it something to, in all good conscience, recommend. ",0
this game is awesome just hurry to get the ball off the green parts its so fun and they don't time you:),1
"I have a lot of fun playing this very simple game but boy does it get frustrating. You go from ""too easy"" to ""aaaah no no no"" quickly at times.It is fun to challenge friends especially.",1
"First off I love it, its a simple to learn game that challenges your previous score and let me tell you its not easy.Second, come on people, just look at the thumb nail, its not a 3d shoot em up game with graphics its a game to exercise your hand eye coo",1
It just keeps going and going and going no real point to the app.not even worth reviewing except to keep anyone elese fromwaisting there time!!!,0
"I love this game. I do recommend! Its so fun! Download now! All you do is move your device back and fourth,but that's fun c:",1
This game is awesome. Its so addictive and so tense. It make you so nervous that your going to lose.,1
this game is not the real falldown from ipod/ipad its not the same at all do not get not fum or addicting,0
Everyone should get this game it is really fun. I could play this game all day. This game is awesome!,1
"I was hoping for the classic falldown game that I used to love. At first I thought it was decent until I noticed that the app stimulation was jerky, and didn't run smoothly. Overall I was very disappointed",0
"i know this is probably stupid, but just by looming at the screen i can tell it is not the best game. it looks boring too. and it is",0
I think you should really get this app because its really cool and fun. its really really good and educationally so try it you'll like it truss me.,1
oh my goodness this app suuuuuuuuuuuucksss!!!!! the device does the game for you. do not get- do not get this horrid app!,0
"notice how all the three and under stars have horrible vocabulary, like good bad and ok?  well how about words like almost wonderful, horrible, and not horrible but not exquisite? - btw. I always get 100% on all my tests at school",1
Hate it. Needs no skill to play. Where are the obstacles? Does the speed ever change? Does it get harder? No options?,0
awesome wowoeowowowowowowows I luves. it hahamy brother I hats hate more than anyothing in the world n I don't,1
This game is extremely addicting!!! I fell in love with it!!! Omg for a free game. AWESOME!! 20 characters yet?,1
I'm so tired of just sitting there.All thee is is just stupid stuff and your just going back and fourth.BORING,0
"Addictive and fun games. As with most games, attention span for me is one week. And then I play once in a while. This game needs no manual, no reference cheat sheets. so I like the fact that this is simple and clean. My daughter enjoys it too.",1
this game doesn't have any fun to it. I mean I got bored in just a second. They also need to make the levels shorter. I would not recomemd this game to anyone who likes REAL fun.,0
"The controls didn't work right on my galaxy tab, it acted like it was always tilted one way and wouldn't go the other way. Frustrating to say the least. otherwise it seems ok.",0
I mean mantel it shut down my kindle and I had to wait for the battery to run down but most of the time it also,1
I am giving this game five stars because everyone that has written a review can not spell for crap. Which means this game might be above their intelligence.,1
Worst game I have ever played. Wast of time the ball falls super slow and the levels are freakishly long.,0
ewwwww this game is awful. It put me to sleep. donor buy this lame exuse they call a game read the comments this game ducks.,0
Sometimes it is nice to have an app where no thinking is required and anyone from the very young to the very old can play,1
I loved it on my old ipod but unfortunately. it broke but then I got my kindle and Mt favorite game ever!!!!!!,1
this game sucks so bad all you do is tilt it sometimes the tilt does not even work this game isn't worth your time,0
I at first thought when I first saw the pictures of this game it was going to be one of those cheesy old time arcade games. but when I played it I fell in love with it. plz do get this app.,1
when ever I go it always makes me force close the app and I cant play the app at all I try downloading again and it still doesn't work when I download the app again,0
"I first looked at the app reviews and one of them asked why it had four stars because they thought it was terrible.Then I saw a lot of other reviews about it being the best app ever, so I wasn't really sure what to exspect. Anyway, the app is fun and is ",1
"A very nice little draw/paint program. Even has an undo button, unlike a lot of free drawing programs.A good selection of brushes.If you want a nice little doodling program then give this a try.It would help if those who review Android apps would indicat",1
"It was an ok drawing app until it froze the background color.  It has the basic brush types (round, square, spray etc.) You can choose colors and sizes for your brush. However,  when I tried to change the background color it froze on the third color choi",0
Even the kids have a good time with this one no matter how old they are. Take it to appointments with you. I guarentee you won'thave to wait. When ever you have something to do and aren't bored it seems like they take you in right away. Try it.,1
this is agreat game i find myself stuck to it awesome its a great time saver i love it don't hate on this app,1
When I tried it the first time I thought it is not hard so I was on the part where you have to press red white blue and green I pressed the colored letters and I lost but then I tried it a different yay and still did not work so I stopped playing this ga,0
I dislike this app because it is not very funny.  It's not even to see if you are smart. I think any app would be better than this. Now you know why it's FREE.,0
"got past first level and then got stuck! no matter what I do, it doesn't let me past that question! don't wast time or memory on this thing! :/HOPEFULLY THIS WAS HELPFUL",0
this game is so stupid! if u bother to get this.. u will regret it and delete. so don't get it and save 20 mins of your life.,0
"I only got this because I didn't want to spend money for the moron test. The game has almost all of the same questions as the Moron test, and it looks like these people did this on word 1997 there are no pictures or any background its just unapealing. Th",0
I completed the game but it was very challenging. A game like this deserves 5 stars even though it was short.,1
when I read the reviews I thought that cant be that bad but it is so don't get but nobody is going to stop you,0
after the 6:45 clock don't press the arrow that says checkpoint instead look for the next written to the side of the screen in small letters press that and you go on to the next question which is not a repeat question I hope this was helpful,1
This game is not fun at all!!!! After about 10 questions this was uninstalled. I think the Moron test is way better. I would rate this a zer0 if I could. Boringest game EVER!!!!!!!,0
I finished the app so I know what to do. At the white screen were it says FINISH. Press it. I know it says that  u failed but it's a trick. On the right hand corner in red but really tiny it says FINISH.then u have finished the game. YOUR WELCOME,1
"This seems like its supposed to be good but its soooooooo not. pathetic copyoff of moron test (which is actually good. moron test, that is)",0
The game is the same every time. There's 4 or 5 questions that you have to answer. You loose every time. I know  this because me and my sister did a test on it.,0
I was playing this app and I acidently hit back and it made me restart so I did but then it kept saying I got the Answer wrong when I gave the same answer as before.Bad app. and as said before copy of Morin test.,0
okay I know this might be really stupid and I am a loser soooo the first stupid question kept on calling me a loser.  I HATE THIS GAME SSSSSOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!,0
"I enjoy this app and i have no idea why so many people cannot figure it out. Yes, it takes some OBSERVATION of every screen you meet and maybe some patience, it is still possible to beat the game if you are smart enough. It will call you a dummy until yo",1
It's. horrible! I didn't get it Cu's I read that it was a total ripoff. it's a copycat and boring game!! just remember that u not a moron or idiot or a loser cuz that game is a total lie and copier justso u no!!!!!,0
THIS GAME SUCKS. ITS JUST A COPYCAT OR THE MORON AND STUPID TESTS. DON'T BUY IT ITS JUST A WASTE OF YOUR KINDLE SPACE,0
How do the finish to finish is when it says loser there's a finish in the corner you wok n lol,1
I played it until I got to the press number six page I couldn't get it it's also a copy of the first game the Moran test and the stupid test also its calls you loser if you fail!  Deleted it with a hour of use. Do not get this app,0
So cool and funny is like your in funny town my life is so cool with this thing us ha,1
this app is fun if you have nothing to do. i have beat this app so i decided to test my friends! this app will get you hooked and you wont want to stop until you beat it.,1
this app is plain and a rip off of the moron test it just looks like something a child made AWFUL APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU LIKE STUPID GAMES thank you,0
"The game is interesting.... for five minutes. Then, you get a question wrong, it says &quot; LOSER! YOU FAIL!&quot; and then you have to start over. And when I say start over, I don't mean start the level over. I mean THE WHOLE GAME! then, you have to do",0
This WIDGET is all I need........................................................)............... Get it it is a widget and not an ape I hope all the people that complain of not opening know how to operate a smart phone,1
I use this app every day. It's a very convenient app since I keep it on my desktop. I highly recommend it.,1
"This app did nothing for me.  In fact, i deleted it pretty soon after installing it.  Sorry to the developer that i can't say anything positive.",0
"I got this because the icon says 76%, not rounded to the lower tenth, however the widget only shows remaining life in increments of ten. Very misleading.",0
I keep the icon on my main home screen so I can easily control GPS and WIFI. Also shows what apps and tasks use the most battery.,1
does exactly what it claims and is far more accurate than stock battery icon in the corner (galaxy tab). often my stock battery icon will show full battery all the way down to 80% or so but this shows you how much you actually have.,1
"This does what it promises to do and is a simple and small widget. Not sure why all the haters gotta hate, if you don't like the permissions then don't load the app. It works just fine for me!",1
"Installed it so i could have a visual as well as a numerical display of remaining battery but it doesn't refresh, i plugged my phone up to the charger and completely charged it but the widget showed it was still charging and only at 56%, uninstall lg est",0
I know you can dig around in settings to find out the amount of battery remaining and what is using up your power. But to know your usage at a quick glance is beneficial. This does not tell you what is using up your power but will give you a snapshop of ,1
Just what i needed.  i dont know why there is no option to display battery life percentage on the Android os.  the little green battery that changes to orange isnt very useful,1
I've used this app in my last two smart phones. These new Smart phones take so much power and most times need recharging befor the end of the day. This app keeps you up to date on the battery status. Recommend to all.,1
why does a battery indicator require my gps location how crazy is this bull crap if you think about it.,0
This is the first app I've ever downloaded that I wasn't able to open in the year that I've had this phone. Lame. HTC Incredible 2.2 Froyo.,0
"not only does this application not work, but it occludes important safety issues surrounding xray use from the public, which is a real travesty. this app should be removdd from the app store",0
SHOWED THESE TO FRIENDS MOST OF THEM GOT FOOLED BUT ONE ****** GUY CAUGHT THE TRICK LOL NICE FOOLIN APP.,1
Did you even look at the description? &quot;Prank&quot; and &quot;joke&quot; doesn't make sense to you? Let me know when you decide to go back to kindergarten and learn to read.,0
This was not as good as it appeared.  A waste of my time to download and navigate.  I deleted it as soon as I got it.,0
I tried many ways to get it to work for me but it didnt. So I say that you should be careful getting it,0
Why does this game have two stars overall? It should have on e it doesn't even move where u move it! Horrible game doesn't show my foot either!,0
This app doesn't let you scan yourself. It's an app to prank your friends. When I talked to the creator of this app he said that he wanted an app that lets you prank your friends with an X-Ray. I asked him why didn't he make an app that actually works by,0
Corny. Now I don't know how to uninstall it. Can someone help me please ? Kids might could fool each other once with it.I really dont want this on my phone. How do I get it off? No uninstall button.,0
this app does nothing. it has no point and doesn't work. It is a waste of time and space! I recommend you don't get this app,0
"very poor quality, only 2 body parts to choose from. hard to scroll because of bad sensitivity to movement. needs work first then could be a three star app. evo 4g",0
"This is so lame I was pointing it at the ceiling then pressed left, and right foot,right hand, and left hand but it still showed the hand even though I wasn't pointing at it.",0
Should have listened to the other reviews.  This is just plain dumb.  I can understand it's meant as a joke and it can't actually xray.  But it doesnt even pull that off properly.  Any time u spend downloading is just time you will never get back and wis,0
I hate this app it's just a pic of a X-ray hand and that's it awful app :( awww man I have to keep writing done well bye,0
"When I tried to play it, it didn't even move. A waste of my space is all it is to me",0
"This app sucks OK so today is October 6 2013 Sunday and I broke my finger TuesdayOctober 1 and it still has not healed well it says my finger is perfectly fine. Oh and get this, xrayed my foot and it says there are three joints in my big toe m and I did ",0
Not even a real app to tell you the truth. Its not worth anyone's time.I would delete this app from my memory if i could thats how bad it is.,0
FYI we all read the description and we knew it was a prank app. I tried it on all my friends and NONE OF THEM FELL FOR IT. So yeah this app is defiantly not my favorite.,0
RIP OFF. Don't think it's gonna scan anything. All it does is let you look at the foot or the hand. And it's some other persons hand or foot. Ok well just dont get it,0
"This app is only for entertainment. Plus it is a waste of time for using your Amazon coins for silly reasons to scan FAKE prints. This may be for children like -4 but otherwise, it's still, don't waste Amazon coinsStay cool :D",0
well i haven't even tried it out yet but from all of yalls reviews i really don't know so wish me good luck!!!,0
"with all the bad reviews and having only one star, how can this possibly be in the top 100, let alone number 16. I don't get it.",0
what kind of a crap game is this it sucks big time man DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!? DEAD SERIOUS RETARDED. THIS DOESENT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR,0
Guys you think It is stupid. Wow. It is to prank your friends I mean read the description. First read description you think you guys are so cool judging an app make a better one then if you think this one sucks,1
THIS app (says in the beginning)its an illusion not an actual xray scanner.also its for people to prank others and you can only pretend scan your right hand or left foot! talk about SUPER LAME..might wanna mention this application!!!,0
"Looks pretty fake, but it's actually kind of cool. More of a one time app. Not really going to go back to it much, since it's just a silly app.",1
This is horrible.  The ads are so big you can't even play with it.  The graphics are fuzzy.  The calibration is a joke.  Just a poor app.  Even at free it is no good.,0
its pretty weak... the calibration is off and it is just a waste of time. won't entertain anyone at a party. unbelievable. just plain sucks.,0
IT DOES NOT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WILL NOT SHOW U UR HAND WILL SHOW U A RANDOM X-RAY OF SOMEONE ELSE'S!!!!,0
"Unless I missed something, I don't find any practical use for this item except maybe have a laff or to.Not for me.",0
"This game Was not fast enough.  Did not like it, so didn't play it.  Nothing else to say on this subject.",0
This isn't real and it really doesn't work so I say don't get this app it sucks like crap and I thought it would actually work,0
i loaded it and pranked my geniuos son even. i am going to have fun with this one. takes about 5 mins of practice to mater all the tilting. i did it zig zaging like i was scanning. I even yelled yo hold still. lol,1
Pointless. Not realistic at all. Nothing good to say about this one. I guess you have to be into this sort of thing.,0
My kids love it. It is fun to play with. It would be better if it had kid size on it.,1
This is the worst app ever all that you can do is scan your right foot or your right hand. I don't even think that was my hand. :(:(:(:(:(,0
I just got this as interest.. it didn't last long and just wasnt that cool to play with so it is gone,0
I tried to scan my hand and it is fake and my foot but it won't let me so I can scan my hand,0
This app is a total waste of your time. The free version sucks just like the one for $.99. It's a rip off take my advice and don't waste your time,0
It was horrible my 5 yr. old brother knew it was fake from the beginning...it moves.on its own I don't recommend.it,0
I hate this app it the worst one in the world I wish I could remove it from all you good peaple it SSSSSUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!,0
It sucks. How do you scan your hand? All it has is a picture of a hand and tilt it. Deleting it now. Never download it. It sucks.,0
not worth downloadin. simple crap and not gonna convience your friends. doesnt show whole as shown photo. doesnt do as descibed. removd app within a minute from downloading,0
"it is a prank app that half the time you cant get into. DO NOT BUY, IT IS A WASTE OF STORAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"was stupid and didn't work, my son downloaded this to try and he didn't even like it so we uninstalled it",0
Not a X-ray A Scanner Just A Picture Of A Skeleton Hand With You Tilting Your Device Diffrent Ways To See More Of It Not Ya Hand In fact My Kindle Fire's Camra Was Looking At My Face It's A Rip Off Even Tho It's Free Because It Takes Up Space The Bought ,0
"Downloaded for a laugh, didn't think it would actually work (it doesn't, app even tells you on startup that its not real, which is fine). The problem is the calibration on the thing is off, I was tilting my phone all over the place and nothing was workin",0
This game is boring and I don't recommend that you get this game. This game is super LAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Love Victoria,0
"slow startup, then once you select your options, the screen goes black and locked my phone up! had to remove battery. not a well written app.",0
Dude its prank duuuhh read the description before u get this its good app to prank your friends ha ha ha ha ha aha ahaahaa yah its good,1
this is the best old time radio app with approximately a thousand classic radio programs. This is a free app that contains everything a paid app would be.,1
"This has some of the coolest old time radio programs in it.  There are programs from comedy, drama, western, mystery and much more...to many to write about.  Get &#34;OLD TIME RADIO PLAYER&#34;, you'll enjoy it.",1
"A must have for fans of Old Time Radio programming. I use this every day. The Shadow, Jack Benny and much more.",1

"My family loves listening to the old radio shows!  I explain to the kids that before TV, this was the entertainment.  It'a a great app - some shows are a bit hard to hear, but it's only a few shows, so I think it's a matter of the original content not be",1
"My husband and I sat down and couldn't believe we could enjoy George Burns & Gracie Allen, Don Ameche, Frances Langford, Abbott and Costello and so many other famous radio personalities.  It really was like going back in time and sitting around the radio",1
"This is such a great and easy way to listen to the old radio programs. If you have grandparents, they will love this app.  It has tons of old radio shows. It includes The Lone Ranger and Dragnet. It even includes the original War Of The Worlds radio show",1
"This is one of the best apps for the Android Velocity Cruz T301 Tablet, and it's free!  :p  I've never heard Amos and Andy, Jack Benny, etc. and all of the shows they had on the radio before television was invented. :)",1
Love this app. It has so many shows to listen to and great quality in sound. All very original. I love CBS MYSTERY THEATER the best.,1

I love these shows. This is when radio was king and the imagination was unbridled. If only we had some of these shows more often today...,1
"I like to listen to Old Time Radio, detectives, mystery, suspense, adventure, sci-fi and westerns.  This one does it all and unlike the Old Time Detectives app, you don't have to listen to Adam at the start and end of each episode.  Plus this app has a p",1

"A great app that does what it says. For those with reading comprehension problems, the camera permissions are clearly explained in the description. You can take a photo to be included in the reminder. There are no communication permissions so it can't se",1
this app I use on my kindle fire and helps me so much. me and my finance are just living. on our own. for the first time and it really hepls us know where we stand financially.,1
HighlyThis has been a great tool to budget mymoney.  very easy to set up and edit as needed.  Would highly reccomend this.,1
This is a great app. it really helps with keeping track of bills by offering a payment reminder and it is very easy to use and understand.,1
"Some funny a s s reviews at the bottom. lol. Anyway, great app and would highly recommend it to those that need help remembering",1
Exactly what i needed.  Ive kept a notebook listing in and outs paids and to be paids and then i found this app. It took me about 30 mins to add everything exactly how i wanted it and now i can relax and have it keep track of monthly bills for me. Tjank ,1
So far this app is doing what it says it does. Easier for me to use instead of keeping track of my bills on a notepad. It free so try it.,1

"Who needs an app to remind them the rent is due? That's what moms are for. When my rent is due, my mom just hollers down the stairs and reminds me.",1
this is a nice little device for those who have a bad memory. it helps me remember when my bills are due.,1
"The app is obviously a good idea. I know this, not from experience, but because I can use my brain. Not everyone pays a single rent, cable, and cell bill once a month, like me. I know that there are people out there with more than three bills. Some peopl",1
This app is another great app by Handy Apps.Works well and is easy to use.I only wish there was an online snyced version to use as a alternitive.,1

Aside from a few glitches (deleted bill reminders still showing up months later) this is a great little app.  When my computer stopped working a few months ago I lost access to my Quicken bill reminders and this app saved me a lot of hassle and potential,1

I couldn't even play the game because it showed up too tiny on my kindle. would not recommend it to any one.,0
My son loves the game and enjoys playing this game on the ipad.  He also likes the timing feature on the game.,1
This is my favorite checkers game.  It is very challenging and fun to play. I would purchase from Bluesky Studio again.,1
this is an amazing app!  I bought it almost a year ago...happy 2 pay full price because of the quality! I have never even noticed &quot;in-app purchases&quot; because I was 2 busy creating pottery! the point of the entire game is to make pottery &amp; se,1

If you like to be creative and also be  challenged to match shape size and color of interesting pottery designs.or make your own custome designs you will enjoy this app. well worth the money for app an any brush packs you may add on,1

"I don't mind IAPs when the app is free and the IAPs give an advantage, but not when the IAP required to complete out unlock everything. Then on top of that, this game isn't free.",0
These devs are only out to rip people off. I feel for those that paid full price for this only to have their time investment taken away. Don't support these scumbags.,0
terrible in app purchase.  if the program uses Iap then it should be free.  and it should tell you up front what and how much the iap.,0
If you like creativity buy this. its fantastic and very addictivenalso it has a very good game pace. I strongly recomment it,1

this is the best app I have seen so far it is my favorite one to use on my amazing kindle fire thank you amazon!,1
The problem is that the programming causes the app to force close constantly. This is a five-star application once it is fixed. My suggestion: download it today to get it free then wait for them to get their act together.,0
Works perfectly on my kindle fire. Easy to play and it fun. I played for about 10 minutes after I got this app.  Love it!,1
I love this game its so interesting yet it keeps force closing. please please fix it please! this is one of those games that are just too cool to not fix,1

"I love this game, so it gets 5 stars. but honestly, there's next to zero animation in this game, it shouldn't tax the system in any way so why so much stuttering and force closing? I can only guess it's poor programming. could be the device (fire) but si",1

This app was so much fun. I really enjoyed playing it. After the update it stopped force closing and I beat it. I enjoyed playing all the levels and quests. It was very enjoyable.,1

i got this app on my kindle fire and it works perfectly fine. all those people that say that it forces close u guys are wrong.,1
It would have been a five stared. but it kips fore closing me. so I have to give it one star. I really hope they fix it soon. DON'T WAST YOUR MONY ON IT UNTIL THEY FIX IT.,0
I love Doodle God so much on the computer I saw it on here... sometimes it has glitches other than that very addicting!(:,1
I really like it. I wouldn't get it for 3 dollars though so I'm really glad its free today. Its a thinking game so i recommend it for people who like puzzles.,1
"This is a great game unlike any I have played before. No speed or hand to eye coordination, just concentration.",1
"I loved this game. For. 99, I thought it was worth it. Too bad it had to end. It was challenging, but I like that (Most of the time I had to use hints.).",1
I had always really loved this game before it came out on the mobile devices but now I think its even better.  it was really fun and time consuming. well at least after they fixed the force close bug,1
this game is well...THE MOST AWSOME FLIPPING GAME EVER!  well besides minecreaft...obviously.  how far am I?  Allmost done!  ha ha!  this game is tarific!  buy it for unlimited fun!  really worth it.,1
I have done the hole intier thang. I love it it is for me and it will for you too.Get This App!,1
idk what the people are saying about force close because it hasn't happened to me at all and this game works great on the kindle fire... ;) very fun game but there was an element that surprised me.. humanxhuman=? lol,1
My kids and I spend hours seeing who can get a new creation. We love it. Great fun for the whole family.,1
"I picked this one up just to look at play mechanics and a week later I was still playing it.  My wife then started stealing my phone so she could play it too.Great purchase, looking for future enhancements.",1
"This game is really great...for about the first two minutes of anytime you open it. Unfortunately, it freezes up WAY too often. Please fix for a better rating. Samsung Nexus",0
fun game easy and fun to burn up a few hours on a flight or buss ride word word word,1
"I've always loved this game! Was so happy when it came out for free on Amazon apps. Didn't know it had the bonus games after each episode...they are fantastic! Thanks for a great game, and great experience.",1
"The graphics in this game are so adorable that I can't help but love it. It is kind of exasperating trying to find the right combinations, but that is what makes the game challenging.",1
"I thought it was great. Totally worth $2.99 but hey, I got it for free! Those of you who have Kindle Fires,it works awesome. Good graphics too!",1
Its so fun! Its entertaining. This is something to get! Its not frusterating. Its easy! Sorry for so many its lol.,1
All you do is constantly combine the same elements over and over again in hopes of making something new. Can't imagine how much torture it will be for those who play often to find new elements. I would not recommend this game at all. It's painfully borin,0
"This seems like one of those games where it's stupid and you'll just end up leaving it out of your carousel (meaning never seeing it again) but then you start playing it, then you get mad because you can't find another match, so then you play it again...",1

fun. simple. addictive. You will find yourself playing for hours. Tell your friends and get yours now! Get Doodle Devil too!,1
Personally I love this game. It's really fun but too easy for me. I restarted the whole game 3 times already and the Doodle God 2 needs to come on Amazon.,1

"I had the same problem as everyone else; I made about fifty elements and after that it would force close. But Lo! and behold, at 12:50 AM, an update came in that fixed the whole thing! No more force close! I am thinking about getting the other two.",1
"Edit: Update fixed it, great game!!Great game until you get about 20-30 minutes in, then it force closes every time you try combining elements. Clear data resolves, but you've lost your progress at that point and eventually it'll do the same thing. I hop",1
you guys make that so fun but you need to make some easier ones because I tried something and it didn't work then I asked for a hint and it gave me it,1
so far my favorite good game theirs a lot to do fun pretty good except it keeps crashing but they'll fix it I'm sure,1
"Great game until I reached about 27 elements and now I can't play it, it keeps crashing - force close every time I select a second element. It would have been 4-5 starsif it worked. Please fix it...",0

I am totally addicted to this game. there are challenging parts but the hints help. I love this game and I would recommend getting it. I didn't have it long before I found I was unable to put it down. AMAZING GAME!,1

this game is really cool!!!!! there is so much to do- elements and creating them. it works perfectly on my kindle fire!!!!!!!!! thank you amazon,1
this is a really great game to pass the time or for anything but i wish they gave you more extra hints.,1
"I loved this casual game and recommend it to anyone. You combine elements like water, fire, dirt to make new things and after you have completed most of the game there is more things that open up to you to do.",1
"this is a great game it really is more of a puzzle game than any other but its actually fun,  its challenging but if you cant figure it out it gives you helpfull hints its really fun",1

"Before the update today, I was getting the force close message but now that they had an update that fixed that problem, it is an awesome game again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

it is easy to figure out but also confusing once u get more completed. the more elements u have the harder it is though. overall pretty good game,1

Problem fixed great gameSame problem. 28 elements and force close. Hope you fix this soon so you can get 5 stars.In your comments you asked for 5 stars to keep the updates coming. I think if you update it you will get the 5 stars coming.,1

This is a cool game. It is harder than it looks. There is currently a crash problem but I am sure it will be fixed with next update. This is sort of a puzzle type game and I love this type of a game on phones and tablets.,1

Yet another free app downloaded and deleted within 5 minutes. They couldn't come up with an original name; you can guess how good the game is... 1 star for a bald face attempt to get some sales by using a similar name to that other bird game.,0

Haven't quite got the hang of it yet and it starts acting up. Maybe I will try again after an update or uninstall altogether.,1
I love this game. It works quite well on my kindle fire.... this is not your average match three game. The creators really did something cute with this one. Highly recommended!!,1

One of the best free apps . One does not expect a boardgame to be so much fun.  The airplane theme makes the game work.  Super fun.!,1

for anyone who remembers the classic board game 'aggravation' this is essentially it!! its simple and fun for all ages in my opinion. its really nice to play and everyone should give it a try! :-),1

This is fun with a capital &#34;F&#34; !!! So easy to play and works just like a real pin ball machine. Different games within keeps it fresh and non boring. This is a game I will enjoy for a long time. GREAT for kids as well. I highly recommend this app,1

"cards too small, not as workable or customisable as I like. it is OK for a quick game, but I like playing for longer periods of time",0
This type of solitaire is what I like best and I found it at Amazon.I can take it with me anywhere. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD.I would recommend it to anyone who likes solitaire.,1
I enjoy playing solitaire and have for many years. It is convenient to play on the computer. My sight is not as good as it used to be so being able to see the cards on the computer is a plus.,1
this game is a true classic.  you get into it and can get totally lost.  time slips away and you get so involved into it. love it.,1
I like this great game.  Please try this great game.  I really enjoy this great game.  great game.  try this.,1
Plain old sol.  This is an easy to use game that even gives hints when you are stumped and ready to quit.  It will deal hands that can be beat or random deals.  For the price it can't be beat.,1

No good. Do not get this app. Don't even know how it made it in app store. Samsung fascinate. Delete and never come back. :),0
they say that it is free and you play maybe two or so levels and then you can't play anymore unless you buy the whole game so really not worth taking your time to dowload on anything unless you want to actually buy the game after a few mintues of playing,0
Loved this game!!!!  All strategy games are fun but thought this one was really fun and kept me entertained for quite a while.,1
if you guys are complaining I think you are crazy. Mine worked fine like the one on the computer. There is no difference. It may not have worked for you people but it worked fine for me. YOU WILL NEVR MAKE ME COMPLAIN!,1

I wish I had read the reviews before buying. First bad app I've bought.  Don't waste your money.  What else can I say?,0

Does exactly what it would do on a laptop but now I could use it on my phone.  Easy to navigate.,1
U- Stream app works great. It allows streaming content on U-Stream on a Kindle Fire that was unable to watch by just going to the U-Stream website. (Kindle users store this app on your cloud storage so as to not use up your internal memory.),1

The app itself works great.  I got the two week free trial on my Kindle Fire and was very pleased with it.  But I was disappointed to find out that it was $10 A MONTH to use it on a tablet or mobile device after the two weeks were up.  That's $120 a year,0

I've not played a puzzle game like this before. It's a simple concept but can be quite a challenge. The closest game I know to compare this to is Picross without the numbers.,1

THIS GAME IS VERY FUN TO PLAY AND YOU CAN REALLY GET HOOKED ON IT. I FIND MYSELF NOT WANTING TO PUT MY TABLET DOWN WHEN I PLAY.,1
Classic Jewels is a lot of fun and captures your attention right away.  Cannot put it down once started.  Don't start if you are short on  time as it can be so fascinating that you won't put it down.,1
You can play this game for hours and not get tired of it.  It is challenging to find the most gems in a row to earn more points.,1
"I love this game, Bejeweled 2 was my favorite game like this, but after playing this I think it's as good or better. Most games like this don't move diagnal but this one does and it adds to the exitment. A+",1
Prefer the Bejeweled game I've played on my sons I-Pad.  This one on the Kindle is very boring. Hope the Kindle will soon have another option. I've tried them all that are currently on the Kindle. None are fun for me.,0

Just bought this before it went free :( Works great on the Motorola Xoom (Android 3.1). Fun and addicting. Great puzzler.,1
This is one of those love/hate things for me. Some levels can be done on my first try and then I work on others until I am ready to throw the phone ... yet can't just walk away.,1
I love this game!!  It's awesome fun.  Screen calibration seems a bit off but it runs fine on a Coby Kyros 7024.,1

"It's been a long time since I took the time to review an app, but this dang thing has been so hard to use and gotten me lost so often, I just have to.  The original app was fine.  It's the devil updates.  Bye, Mapquest!",0
Not that I have ever been lost but it is nice to know with very little effort I can find places and directions from where I am.,1

"Great idea.  As long as you have to walk around with a GPS locator on your person for 'Big Brother' to find you whenever he wants to, you might as well get some personal use out of it.  Tracking devices are another good idea if you think it's necessary. ",1
This app is SUPER!! It tells you everything and anything you want or need to know to get anywhere! Even has a GPS that gives you explicit directions. I'm soooo glad I have it. I used to get lost going around the corner. A must have for all people whether,1

"This is marvelous.  Easy to use, syncs to my PC.  Available thru the cloud.  Reminders and such.  I don't really like todo lists but this one works well.",1
"Free, easy to learn, customizable, and syncs to all platforms...hands down the best of its kind. If you're looking for a to-do list w/multiple lists, reminders, and the option to upgrade for sharing options, look no further.",1
I downloaded it on my EFun Nextbook and it works great and is very easy to use.  You can even get reminders in you email.I recommend this app.,1
"I've tried some of the best selling To-Do apps and none have been as easy to use as this one. In addition to the ease of use, I can program sub-tasks, set due dates and set reminders. There's even a space to type notes under each to-do item. Overall, it'",1
I love Wunderlist. It's not too complicated and has a clean design. Its easy to use too.I wanted a simple list app and this is it.,1
This is amazing. You can make lists and organize them neatly and quickly. I also like the fact that you can connect it with your facebook or tootle account. This is a great app overall. I really recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good notetaking,1
"This app works great! I use yahoo whereas the other apps want to use Gmail or only works on phones. This app works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I set a reminder, and on the specified time and date, an email is sent as a reminder to my Yahoo account, which",1
"I really love this app. I had Astrid before this & it was a good app but this one is ten times better. You get to set the background pic of your inbox, there is an additional note pad area for extra note-taking, & you can set reminders for specific tasks",1

I have been trying to find a to do list type app for the longest that really fit my needs. I have downloaded and removed several trying to find the best one. I've finally did with wunderlist. Not only does it sync across devises but i can make sub-lists ,1
"It's free, functional, and works really well, with companion apps on pretty much every platform so my tasks are accessible on whatever device I'm using. One of the main reasons I switched from using Google Tasks.",1
Not useful or helpful.  Left a lot of stuff on my computer when I downloaded it. Not recommended at all.,0

"While I could set the the task on the calendar, I could not figure out how to set a notification for the task.  Would not recommend.",0
So how does the app work? Where are any instructions.  Load the app in your Kindle and you can spend the next 8 hours trying to make it work. Very frustrating. Not straightforward. Maybe the instructions are hidden somewhere.,0
I really like the ease of making up different lists in this app. Easy to mark things off as they are completed and you can either delete them entirely or leave them to recall what you did.  I highly recommend this app for those who need to keep track of ,1
"This is the best list making app. A few sync errors with repeating due dates only with my android phone, LG optimus L9 and the kindle fire. It only does it with repeating due dates that are daily. Other than that it is perfect, and I've tried out lots of",1
"I needed a task manager that worked across a Macbook, my Kindle, and a Samsung phone.  Wunderlist does it without fail.  Highly recommend.",1
This is my favorite of the many many apps I have used to try to digitize my many temporary and recurring lists. I use this for so much more than just to-dos.,1

"I was apprehensive about this app, but that disappeared when I found how simple it was to load on my PC. my Kindle, and my iPhone. All three were synced as easy as can be. Very flexible and I probably will find it more and more useful as I get in the hab",1
"I use Wunderlist ALL the time.  It's a great app.  Easy to use and full of functionality.  If you use lists for anything, download it now.",1
I like writing a shopping list and being able to complete a shopping list on my Kindle is really great.  I am also able to email this shopping list to my finance and she can update the information.  Those chances made will update on my wunderlist program,1
I love this program. It allows me to sync my laptop to-do lists with my kindle so I have them when I'm out and about or don't want to get on my laptop. It's a great way to keep myself organized and knowing whats due when.,1

yeah--you know it--fun just to sit and pop the bubble wrap and kill some time and stress relief...even makes a sweet bubble pop noise when you pop the bubbles...do a sheet--scoot to the next one or just shake the mobile or tablet and it resets...have fun,1
"maybe you people like it, but I don't. I got bored of it after a two minutes. I do not suggest this app. its boring.",0

"No need to buy an audio book.  this one reads epubs to you while driving!  I recommend the free text to speech app called IVONA to go along with this.  Set it up on your android and it sounds more natural.  Still somewhat mono-tonic, but very acceptable!",1
It is easy to use and a good epub would reccomend it to any one . it is  Fast and easy to use.,1

"But if you could get over that, this is a very fun puzzle game that will really give your brain a jolt.",1
I found this because I liked the crosswords by Teazel and wanted to see what else they had. This type of game is new to me but after just a couple of puzzles in the free version I was hooked and had to buy the full game. No glitches so far. Keep up the g,1
This game plays just like the codeword games in the puzzle magazines. The games are challenging but possible. A great way to exercise your brain!,1
This is one of the nicest codewords puzzle apps that I've tried.  It has a very intuitive interface and a good help system.,1
"Excellent word puzzler!  The puzzles do get harder, which is good.  I do wish you could enter letters from the display of remaining letters, in addition to the keyboard below it.",1
Deciphering the words with no clues is very relaxing for me.  It makes me think with no pressure.  And it is not timed.  Try it.,1
"I enjoy playing Codewords. Being able to check my work without seeing the answers is a very helpful feature, and the puzzles are challenging without being too difficult. Definitely worth the $1.99!",1
I have always enjoyed the codewords game from the puzzle magazines and this is a very good app that plays just as easily as I have always enjoyed the game before.I would recommend it to puzzle lover's.,1

was skeptical at first at how well this app would perform but it does what it says it will an quite well too.,1
This is something that my nephew downloaded and he played it the whole time we were camping. It was a little challenging for him though.,1
"It literally took just a few minutes to decide I wanted the paid app.  To see why, look at my review of the paid app.  This is perhaps the best app of its type.  It is far, far more than a typical word generator, app, or whatever you call it.",1
This game is mentaly challenging and helps to keep me on my toes. I'm able to learn new words from playing it!,1
not the game i was hoping for and cant figure it out it is like a dictionary i guess but still dont know what to do with it,0
"I love this game, play it every day, it helps me to learn new words to expand my vocabulary. Highly recommend this product to those trying to expand their vocabulary.",1

"At first I was in love with this game. Then when I bought better stuff, got new refineries, and I actually started to get good at this game, the game rejects my Facebook account, won't allow me to access the refinery I waited three days for to get my 700",0
it is by far the best game I have ever played. glu mobile always outdoes themselves on these sort of games,1
I liked it a lot because it was so good and you could vlbuy such cool stuff and because you get a lot of free stuff,1
"The game is fun and very addictive, the guns are creative, the armors neat, there could be more charecters, but its fun",1

"yes, it's a freemium game where some of the better stuff requires you to buy in-game cash but it's still a blast without those additional items.",1
Takes for ever to download.  I had to try a few different times.  Then I had to remove a bunch of stuff to be able to play it because it is so big.  I finally start playing and the guy only shoots in one direction.  So dumb do not waste your time.,0
Another great game from flu mobile like the graphics and has good weapons id recommend it to anyone that likes shooter,1

An over all good fun game and is interestingly strange I need ten more words and were they are right here,1
pretty easy at first then gets challenging. already have predator and coronal ejector!  I wish you could win flu credit though...,1
I haven't pladd this game but it only had 999 rates so I wanted to be the 1000 lala lala lalala lala lalala lala lala lala lala:) poop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1

if you guys need to know how.to get refineries than log into facebook my name is Pie Pies halpful tipped right their,1
I tried this because I liked the other Glu games contract killer and blood &amp;glory-but couldn't get in to this one.  I found the touch joystick difficult to move my gunbrother where I wanted him to go.,0
I think that it could be a bit cheaper for buying guns and such...but other than that its a great game.,1
This game is really fun.  This is a good game for all ages and it is really hard to stop playing when you get good.,1
Super addictive.  One of the best games on the market. Controls are responsive. Graphics are great. Love it. Get it now,1
"well I tried this game on my ipod, it was amazing but since the ipod can't handle the high temperature.anyway this game gives you good experience.",1
"Its really fun, controls jiffy at times but otherwise a great game, and the paid portion doesn't take ALL the good stuff away",1
This was an awesome game the guns are amazing this game held my attention for like I don't know just for a really long time,1
You can't fast forward or rewind. There is no volume control. Not very user friendly. I think I'll just keep listing on my iPod.,0
"Stops right in the middle of the program on the Kindle Fire.  Furthermore, once you switch apps there is no indicator in status bar or control.",0
"Love it - easy to use and download podcasts from.  The sound is crisp, clear and as entertaining as if you were listening live!",1
I like the shows. It is a lot of fun listening too this great site. Especially A Prairie Home Companion.,1
"I have been looking for a drawing app that does everything and this is it. It is the only drawing app that comes with directions. There are about 20 different brushes to use including the air brush, caligraphy pen, paint splatter and many others. There i",1
I would give it zero stars!  I tweaked all the brush settings and got ready..... I couldn't use the brush...it didn't work. how dumb. do not bother!,0

"every time i pick my finger up from drawing,painting what ever i do it makes me force it close but the up side was it is free!!!!:(",0
"It works well on my kindle...... The color is nice and when u draw, u can have different textures. Its the best drawing app I have......",1
Lots of options for the artist in you to try out. Learn different techniques and styles with this easy to use app.,1
its terrible. very hard to use. and not really for kids nor adults. i know its free but its a no go.,0
"The kids love this, and spend a lot of time with it.  Has been quite entertaining for the family.  As soon as the grand children get to the house, they are ready to open this and play with it.",1
"worth the download,  A lot of fun. I let the grand babies play it and it keeps them occupied if we are in a store or in the car and they get restless",1
This app seems incredible and I want to buy it. This review earns five stars. I love to draw so this app would be perfect for artists like me.,1
"Perfect for playing pictionary in a long car ride, or even just having a little Doodle time:) I&lt;3 this app its perfect for me, and my friends!!!!!!!!!!!",1
It's a wonderful app and awesome on kindle fire. Very advanced for a free app...but its also simple enough that a toddler can use it and choose different colors and brushes by themselves.,1
"This was a silly app to use,  It isn't user friendly and my toddle did not like it.  I didn't even like it just not for me.",0
this game is confusing and just plain weird dont get it and save time. really don't get it I regret waiting three minutes trying to download it.,0
It doesn't glow for one.. It doesn't have different Colorado.. It doesn't let you save pictures.. Takes forever to download.. U have to erase everything u cant clear the page.. Don't get it the drawing pad is unfinished times better than this retarded. t,0
this app is.really fun I love all of the choices!But. sometimes its a little confusing.it runs great on the kindle fire,1
this is the dumbest app ever all you do is draw  draw draw do not get or buy this app,0
"This app I just downloaded it and I have not even tried it but it downloaded so so so so fast I'm impressed because allot of other apps that I download slow and after all the waiting I did, it usually not worth it, they end up being crappier game than I ",1
This app is a very nice and fun app. It's sort of like &quot;Paint&quot; in your computer but you have to really draw shapes like circles instead of just clicking and drag. You draw with your finger.I really like this app. One of my favorite.,1
"For my kindle, it was terrible. It downloaded and all, but I mean, you need a particular software for the anderoid. So it doens't work on the kindle just a heads up",0
I prsanle love this app.so if you love art this is a game for you.it is free so no risk. if you sumit a thing do 5 stares.,1
I love it sooooo much. I can't. halp my it I Ripley to eavre thinks. i love it sooo.  much,1
I drew some pictures I didn't like and accidentally saved them. Now I cant delete them! it is a wretched game. I'll find a BETTER Doodle game.,0

"has some really nice brushes to play with. wish there were just a few more, but what it does come with are really neat",1
"I love this game because there are so many tools you can use and you can make pictures on the to without the mess. if your a art freek, I suggest you get this game",1
Ok I don't know about the rest of you people but unroll i read the total of this app I thought it was a smoking app whoever made this app should serriously reconsider the picture for it. just saying :-l,0
"We downloaded this free app to our tween's new Kindle Fire and she loves it.  It is very user friendly and she has a lot of fun creating her Gallery of ""master"" pieces.  It has a wide variety of colors, brushes and effects for the user to choose from and",1
"The 2 yr old I watch loves the ""playback"" feature, and I think that it is easy to understand for even him.",1
This was purchased for my Grand Kids and they have not been able to try it out as of yet.,1
I like how u can change everything to writing from easering!!!! also u have alot of Colors to pick from!!  if u want to just Doodle this is a great app!!,1
another must have in the back seat to keep the kids happy on a trip in the car must get,1

I unistalled immediately after I downloaded it. There seems to be a problem with it running and crashed my kindle.,0
There are various levels and even some free spins to boost your score.  You can cash out and apply your score to the next game .,1

"This US very boring. It might be worth playing if it rewarded the pocket change it promised but just like every other game or app that's download ed d from Amazon, pocket change doesn't work. Not worth downloading or taking up space e . On your kindle",0
didnt like the game you might so give it a try. sometime people like stuff and i dont so give it a try,0

I really enjoy this game but I like to gamble and I wish you could play more coins at one time. also you should have another bonus game that comes up besides killing the turkeys. I play the horse race and scratch the card and the other but you do not win,1

I play real slits fairly often and lose most of the time. This is realistic and you do not lose.,1
"At least in this free game, you win lots of (unfortunately) money!!! Lol.. well worth the download. Hope to see more as I go.",1
This is a really fun app and keeps me entertained when I am not able to go to the casino.,1
this is exactly what I was looking for! a lot of the other apps are confusing. I could do without the mini games though.,1
i didnt like the app it was very boring and there are planty of apps that have the same concepts that are alot more fun. sorry hope that helped,0

"traded phones and tried others, came back to this one.  You can set up your own ringtones for the alarm, easy to use.  all around best one for me",1
"Very easy to use. Highly customizable. Of all the alarm apps I've tried (there's been many), this is the very best by far.",1
I tried and tried but no matter what I did I could not turn the sound off!! do not install this app it is a wast of time!,0
Great tool. I have been using it for over a year now. Itallows you to use music. Set multiple alarms. Also you can have your device volume seperate from alarm volume.,1
"Love this app. I especially like the hourly grand father clock chimes, although for some reason it occasionally chimes off the hour.",1
"Only alarm clock that has ever worked for me on a regular basis.. no worrying about the volume being turned down on a clock radio, you can set it to wake you up to any song on your phone, or to an app (supposedly like the weather forecast, but I can't fi",1
first I set it for 7 o clock then it woke me up but did not shut up so I deleted the app but it still has the alarm set and I don't know how yo turn it off.,0

I downloaded this app thinking it would be great. I tried it out but it didn't make sound. u would recommend not getting this app.,0
"I used the ad-supported version of this app for about 3 days before I went out and bought the no-ad version; not just to get rid of the slightly annoying ads, but to support the dev for making an amazing alarm app.  I find it mostly impossible to get out",1
I thought I would give it a try.Everytime I would set the alarm it would shut off or stop working.I couldn't get it off my Kindle soon enough!!!!,0
"installs and opens, but crashes when trying to edit an alarm. you can't use the app... i cant further review the app until this is fixed. Five stars when running on my Galaxy S II... :/",0

I love this app. the one thing YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE TO DO is when your setting alarm make sure you set the dismissal. to turn the alarm off you can simply press a button or do a math problem to turn your alarm off. it has.anbutton so that you can play y,1
I really suggest you get this. its free and it still lets you use your music as a choice. and even more there's. setting where you can make it where you have to do math to dismiss it! clever,1
"I just wanted a basic alarm to set. I found some extra's that I didn't know I wanted. Love the nap button, and that I can adjust the snooze time.. Have this app on several devices.",1
I hate it I hate it I can never set a single alarm and it always says that it cannot stay stinken open sunbathing don't get this app ever,0
"I was going to use this as a travel alarm on a recent trip.  Tried to set it up and test it before I went, but I couldn't find the snooze when the alarm sounded.  It may have been there, but I couldn't find a way to shut it down, so I uninstalled it.  I ",0
"The app is a great alarm, and has many customizable options such as selecting your own music to wake you up. There is an option to do math to dismiss the alarm.",1

I wanted to help my math but I thought this app should help but no I want a 5th grade app that's free and actually helps,0
"Pretty pointless.  Unless you like putting thumb tacks in a wall.  Then maybe it's for you.  Random touches on the screen redirect your device from game play to advertising.  Not fun, not exciting, not funny... Uninstalled.",0

it is the perfect time waster pointless and fun over all great app fast download u will want to get this app,1

I love this you can do lots of things I like throwing the shapes at him he gets all bloody buy it BUY IT!!!!!!,1
"I highly recommend this app to very angry people. Just pretend the pinman is your worst enemy! lol, this is also a very good time-wasting game:))",1
this game was boring when I got it I thought that there would be levels or something I have never UNinstalled a game so fast if there was a 0 star I would give it to this game,0
you get to pin a man with tacks and you can turn off the blood. and you can get shapes and throw it at him.,1
this game is terrible you poke a little stick figure with a pushpin and that is all that you do it was a.waste of space and I deleted it because it was boring,0

"all you do is stick a pin in him, as many as you can fit. this gets boring quick. I think I played it once.",0
this is perfect for taking out this guy as in killing him! this is a lot better than punching a sibling,1
I expected this to bad a unique and fun way to waste time simarly to paper toss. but this was a very boring game without any real excitement or fun involved.,0
Use your imagination to have fun. You can pretend like he is a guy who has a new power control or you anything you want.,1
it wont even let me play the freaking game it does force close every time!!! it doesn't solve ur anger issues it make them WORSE!!!,0
"its really fun,but i mean the problem is that from time :o to time it gets boring.........oh! LOLZ! i didn't even try to make that face............anyway,buy it!",1
"right from the start I didn't like it, their was not much do do. Their was an add covering something in the bottom right corner.  I would not download it.",0
"With or without blood splattering turned on, the app gets old quick.  Perhaps if there were something other than geometric shapes to use, the dummy had texture instead of being a stick-like figure, there were some good sound effects,  and realistic blood",0
"Pinman is a fun fun game, which is great for letting out anger (especially with the blood). You can beat him with objects and pin him to the walls. The best part is, I wont get accused of murderer!!!",1
I think this is great if you tap your guy you switch body's and you can switch map download this it is awesome and your gonna like it,1
stupid there is an add in the corner blocking something on the kindle fire STUPID don't get it if you have a kindle fire,0
My son cannot get enough of this silly app. It's very amusing and catchy. Maybe more background effects would be better.,1
A fun game for when you're bored. Sure to get plenty of laughs from this! Also good for those days when you're really mad hahaha(:,1
Every time I tried to play this game it did not open! Awful game I will never play this game again.,0

"As soon as I opened the game, I knew that it would be very funny. I don't mean to sound evil,  but I had a WONDERFUL time TOURTURING the pin man. I hung him by his head, his leg, his arm, and pinning down every part of him and tickling him. NOBODY COULD ",1

"It isn't too hard and is good for a lite challenge. Since, the response dots don't correlate to the dots on the board, you can never be sure you are right. The game is pretty self explanitory, so even beginners shouldn't have too hard of a time winning.",1
I'm running the free version currently and having no problems with it on my kindle fire. I loved playing this with friends years ago. I used to have it on my Pc until windows 7 came out and my game was no longer compatable. So I'm enjoying this on my kin,1

"a fun remake of master mind, or so I've heard. I enjoy never the less and I'm glad I got it.",1
"One of my favorite games; love games to stimulate my brain. If you are not a person to sit and analyze things, don't bother. This takes a lot of thinking. If you like to use your brain give this one a go!!",1
I love this app. Going to buy the pro version. Helps me relax in evening. Happy when I suceed in knowing the placements of the colors in short time. Lets me know my intuition is in tune that day. Plus it's just fun! ;).,1
"I am always glued to this game! Whenever I play it, I never lose! Once you play ot for a while, you get the hang of it. My parents can't even figure this game out, even after I explain it and I show them the directions! But it's perfect for my kind of br",1
This game is a great brain game and never gets boring.  I'm having too much fun to go to the MEDIUM and HARD levels but I'm sure I'll get to them eventually.  My husband is not too thrilled with it but I think it's because he gives up too easily.,1
"If you liked Mastermind you'll love this game in which the computer pegs for you. You don't have to be concerned about your opponent pegging incorrectly.  You can guess five colors, like Mastermind, or three or four for an easier game.",1
this game is awesome!!!! it is so much fun!!my brain hurts when I play it....but....it is SO much fun!!!:{),1
"i absolutely love this game... if you are a person that likes mind games, this game is for you. its not too difficult but it keeps you thinking.",1
Nice version of Mastermind game.  I like that it has three levels and the graphics look very pleasing to the eye.  I just wish the clue pegs' colors were a bit more vivid because it's a bit hard to distinguish between the grey and the white sometimes.,1
"i LOVE this game! there is a board game version of this game, which  i have been pleying my whole life, and this is exactly the same thing!  this app is awesome!!!  if you dont have this app,  GET IT!!!!!!!",1
"Oh, how I hate this game! I mean, the other games they produce are enjoyable, but this, it's an unenjoyable one.",0
when looking for apps to play on a long car ride this one fits all the requirements. including the fact that it doesn't need wi-fi. this is one of my favorite games and it is a great app,1
This game is a great game to play anywhere. It does not need Internet access. That means hours of fun.THANK YOU GET,1

I love this app it is a challanging game of skill and fun. this is so a five star game people!!!!!,1
"As a young boy, I loved the board game &quot;MASTERMIND&quot;.This game is just like it, except it has two great advantages.#1- PLAY VS. CPU:  You don't have to beg your completely uninterested older sister to play the game with you!#2 - VERSATILITY:  Yo",1
I like the ability to change difficulty. I can either challenge myself a lot or a little. My young children even love to try cracking the code!!!!,1
this game is easy and fun its so fun my sister got the actual game at the store I defently recommend this game--Julianna,1
its actually a game that makes me think it finally a game that does what it say its gonna do,1
It is so easy and pretty addicting because I think I played it 20 the first day I got it.,1
"I really like the old Mastermind game, and this is an excellent version of the game. I has never played with pegs missing, so I got something new from this version of the game. Excellent work!",1
"Excellent game, very challenging to the mind and is entertaining to all age groups from age 10 to age 70.",1
I am amazed this mastermind clone is free. It is incredible and I am convinced.it will help your overall thought process. Don't discount it based on the fact that it is a game or inexpensive.  It is a mind gym.My wife loves this. She has a masters degree,1
"This game is everything advertised! It may lack diversity in codes, but still worth it. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a bit of a riddle :)",1
really a fun game never played this type of game before so I was pleased with every aspect of the game 5 stars,1
"This version is awesome. Keep doing great games. Always like this mind challenging games, instead of killing animals and/or other human beings.",1
"Just like Mastermind.  Simple, but very distracting and--I find--relaxing.  Works great on my kindle fire; no problems that I've noticed.",1
I love this game! It's challenging but not so much that it isn't fun. You can play it over and over without getting bored.,1
This game is enjoyable. For all you smarty pants who like puzzle games this one may be for you. Good exercise for the brain and an easy way to pass the time. Glad there are different levels the game works for many age groups.,1
"Like all of Optime Software's games, this is a great puzzle. Solve the code to win the game. Sounds easy, right? Oh, what little you know ;)A big bonus is the &#34;color blind&#34; feature, for those of us who have trouble with subtle shades.",1
This is the game I played with my children.  My 4 year old granddaughter loves to play this on my kindle.,1
"As a kid, we played Mastermind in our house for hours and hours. I loved the deducing of it all and when it all came together quickly, voila! I love that I can play this as a solitaire game, select the level (depends on the number of pegs you want to gue",1
this is cute and fun for kids and smart ones.I say its a mind bender because its difficult to figure out Wich color goes where. I would definitely recommend this app to a friend.especially because I love mind bender's.have fun:D,1
"I loved this game when I was a teenager, I'm so happy to be able to play any time I want to.",1
This game is just like mastermind and is a lot of fun. very addicting to play and easy to learn.,1
"DIDNT GET THE KNACK OF THIS GAME AT ALL..IT HAS NO SENSE OF ANYTHING, GIVES NO FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT NOR IS IT EXCITING ..ITS POOR",0
"Love this version of Mastermind game I played years ago. Great graphics, 3 levels. Plays without issues on my Samsung note 2.",1
"When I was little, I would pester anyone I could into playing Mastermind for hours on end ...and now I can play this by myself. :) Was so happy to find this app! The game is deceptively simple yet challenging - try it!",1
"If you like Mastermind you'll love this. Easy and pleasing interface, multiple difficulty levels, no bugs on the kindle fire.",1
do Not even look at it!! it is soo bad!!  even my sister who love anything you put in front if her didn't. like it. such a lame game!!  :(,0
"This is awesome! This challenges your brain, but its fun as well!! This game is so addicting that even if you are troubled, you still keep going :)",1
its amazing how often I feel like a complete knucklehead with this game but I keep coming back for more! a lot of fun and a great brain game.,1
This is a very entertaining game. Not too difficult but still makes you think a bit. There are different levels for different skill levels.,1
Much fun without a lot of fuss. The ads are less intrusive than I feared too. Good one that works well on the Fire.,1
"It is confusing. I mean, I followed the instructions and all, but it was still confusing. You couldn't guess the code at all!!",0
It's right from the old days of Mastermind. I can understand why some folks are giving this a bad review. I guess they just aren't up for the mental challenge.,1
"I used to have this game in plastic form (Mastermind) and would play it with my son. It's not hard, but makes you think. Great for a free app.",1
"This game is a brain teaser. I love it, love love it. This is a great game. i cannot stop playing it. I would encourage anyone to buy and play this game, especially if you want to keep your brain stimulated. GREAT GAME.",1
"Crack the code is fun. I feel smart after reading these reviews. Puzzles, codes are like knots fun to untangle.",1
I love this game and so do my friends.it is a good game for people who like puzzles :)this a really fun game,1
I know someone says this is imposssble but it'd not. its a fun mind game. and it is amazing on the kindle fire.,1
I got my game for free and thought it would be boring.  I was surprised on how I got caught up into solving the code. Its good for passing the time. I even got my husband hooked on the game :),1
Never thought I'd get hooked on this game.  Helps you think critically hence I won't consider it as a total waste of time.  On the contrary it may be a good brain exerciser.,1
"I played Mastermind with my sisters when I was younger and I never could figure it out.  Now as an adult, I can sometimes get the 3 colors right. Ha, ha!  Still working on my patience and focus to figure out the solution. Definitely worth having for the ",1
I love this game and it is fun to play but it takes a lot of skill and it is like a mind twisted. Do you want to get you brain ready to think? Take a turn at playing the game.Ttyl peace out detectives code crackers!!!!! :),1
i love this app. I always played this game on my Pc and now I can play it all the time. strongly recommend.,1
dont get this game it is totally rigged even if you do get the code right they say that it is wrong,0
this is a fun application to play when you are bored. it is a simple and fun game based off of some math games. it runs smoothly on kindle fire!,1
This is a perfect app if you want to keep your mind active or even just passing time. Highly recommended for people who want to have good mind exercise.,1
"I love puzzle games that make you think., but this game was just boring.  after a couple of levels I just deleted it",0
finally something thag requires logic! lol one of the few games where I am challenged to THINK! I love it. plain and simple:),1
good game... keeps your brain sharp and fun too! only use medium level because that is what the original game has.,1
This game is very fun. I tried to teach my teacher to play but then she wouldn't give it back.,1
"great for flexing your brain. the easy level is still a challenge for me, but this is a great opportunity to exercise logic skills.",1
This is such an addictive game!  It really makes me have to process my moves. My memory is getting bad and my Doc told me that this kind of activity will help me to retain it. I love it!,1
don't buy it. its a waste of time and its LITERALLY impossible to crack the code. Even on EASY! I would rate this a zero if I could.,0
love playing this game. good for problem solving and thinking. Its nice for everyone. it can be tricky but that's the pint right?,1
This is how I remember playing the game years ago.  The game looks great on the Kindle fire.  I would have picked another color than black to indicate that the color chosen was correct and in the proper spot.,1
It works great on my kindle and is VERY addictive! I suggest you to get it I love it a lot!,1
a fun and quick test of your powers of deduction. it encourages critical thinking. and can be fun for the entire family.,1
I don't like it its boring its hard its tricky its something that makes you want to puke don't get it waste of life sorry if you got it that's why I only gave it a star if you want respond to this comment I'm sure you will do.t get the app,0
I discovered thisbst my grandmas house and loved it but I didn't. think id be able to use it ever again till I found this. app. I play it all the time. YAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!,1
Just like the game Mastermind I played when I was a kid. The different levels made it easy to get back into it.  Very addicting!!!!,1
Thank you so much for this app!  I love the new challenge each time I play!  I love playing at the hard level and I can usually guess by the 9th try but there's been enough times that I've gone all the way to the 12th!  And of course I've had my share of,1
Amazing way to kill time if you are goingbon a trip or even if you are just going home! :),1
"this is such a simple &quot;figure out the combination&quot; game that i CANNOT  believe how addictive it is!! good &quot;time killer&quot;. personally though, i haven't lost a game yet!",1
My ten year old loves this app as much as I do. It is so much fun. Easy to use too. I have played for hours.,1
"Thought this would be a challenging game, but the rules left me just guessing.  It wasn't fun, just frustrating.  If someone can tell me how to play, I'll try again, otherwise...",0
"Solve the sequence in which the beads of color appear. Harder levels give you less opportunity to waste guesses. It's a game of deduction, and hones your ability to read between the lines.",1
This game is both mind boggling and fun. I love playing this type of game.Its great! Its like the real board game mastermind which I love playing so this is even better!,1
"I've always loved Mastermind and was looking for an app to imitate the game. This was it. Even better, it has levels of difficulty. Easy to use, and no problems with it freezing or not working properly. Worthwhile download.",1
This is a real great game. Just as I remember as a kid. Works well on Kindle Fire.  Definetly would recommend.,1
"This game is very good for learning logic and reasoning.  l would recommend it to all ages, young and older alike.",1
i hate this one,0
"This is not a game. You follow directions and are told that you've followed directions. There is nothing that you'd recognize as gameplay. If you initiate a &#34;battle&#34; you are informed of the outcome, you don't even get a graphic representation of ",0
"probably the best uken game available, plus its free. I mean really how much more awesome can it get? if you like futuristic d&amp;d style rpg games then this game is for you. (a son's reveiw)",1
"You won't get flashy graphics or even BGM with this title but it is a spectacular game none the less. VBetween leveling up on missions, you can aqquire properties that generate cash used to heal and buy weapons. You can attack other marines on the battle",1

I love this app even though I just got it last night. Best game ever! get this app by all means,1
Uken. I have a big problem I have had this game for a long time and like it a lot. But when I updated it here in the app store it updated it but made me start over at level 1 not sure what to do??,1
ITS JUST A COPY OF FORCES OF WAR!DONT BUY IF U ALREADY HAVE FORCES OF WAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we. ed edd Shasta xbcc,0
"I though this game was gonna be like Supreme Commander or Halo Wars or something but you don't do nothing but push a button and watch the results. It's boring, honestly I think this is a bad idea for a game thumbs down.",0
Usually the lack of animation in games like these turns me away but with dg there's so much under it I barely notice. add me auubn,1
I have downloaded two games made by the author any guess what? they were identical but with a fifteenth theme and name and by reading the description on this on id say its no different. my advice uken? stop parodying your own games!!!,0
"to be completly honest, this is a great game. doesn't get old fast like a lot of games do these days. it is a must play in my opinion. download and enjoy people. AMAZING IS WHAT YOULL SEE",1
"Some games should not be classified as games...not much to do, confusing and boring.  Give it try, graphics are decent but I just couldn't get into it.",0
"love this game, very easy to play no bugs or force closes, opens and plays just fine everytime no problems",1
don't get me tong forces of war is realty good but this is just like it. unending makes games like this they are all good but sometimes to much,1
I never got this game but I wanted to tell you that it is the same thing as Forces of War.,1
Yet another good timekiller! This one has space! They need to make more. Ones with different genres. Most of these are very crime based.,1
"Add Me. This is a good text base game, and so are all the others by Uken. I have all of them and rate each one in my opinion 5 Stars. Uken, keep up the good work!",1
Since I found your company I downloaded almost all of your games but there is a bug in every one of them plead fix it when the his goes off screen for the ones on kindle fire I don't know if it is For all devices but please fix it,1

I think it is very cute an colorful. My daughter enjoys playing the game very much. SHe likes all the dragons.,1
Let's u add track album song info. Great for on the go people that needs to somehow organize media with no access to a computer.,1
This is a great program.  It saved me from needing to copy my mp3s onto my computer and fix it there.  I was able to perform the fixes directly on my tablet.  I used it to fix the album artist info for a bunch of tracks that I copied from a CD that has v,1
"Okay, once caveat - it is easy to use for a novice if you know a little bit about what you are doing!  If you are saying &#34;what's an audio tag?&#34;, then this may not be the program for you, and perhaps a little reading on audio tagging is in order! ",1
Let me update my songs information right in the app. There was no issue doing it and it saved a lot of time instead of going to my computer and fixing it from there.,1
This helped me fix the unknown artist issue and it added album art easily....once I got used to navigating through the program. Very nice!,1
"Gojod app, covers any situation. I buy the full version to support the developer. Able to easily switch between type of calculator needed.",1
Particularly like the unit converter. It is the simplest and easiest I have found for all basic unit conversions. Well worth a buck for all this app can do.,1
"""Calculator Ultimate"" is an outstanding calculator app. The scientific functions are exactly what I was looking for and it has a great, easy to use layout. The addition of a unit converter (which gets a lot of use) makes this a real winner!Installed and ",1

"This has got to be the most limited, unintuitive product I have ever purchased.  If you still have your old HP or Texas Instrument calculator - keep them and let this piece of junk go by the wayside.",0
"I just purchased this calculator- and initially in the length conversions, appeared to be very limited in range- so I emailed Duckseason at their support address- and received an answer the same morning- with instructions how to access the additional con",1
Than just a calculator. Just like having a TI science calc.Convenient to have with your books. Would recommend to anyone,1
The only problem that I had with the app was that the help was lacking.  It took a minute before I found out that to completely clear out previous calculations I had to HOLD the Ci button.  If the dev team reads this consider adding things like that in t,1
"Very nice app, works great and is very easy to use, the developers did a great job with this one. Thanks all, looking forward to more good works from all of you.",1
Perfect for what I need. And has ability to do the more complicated stuff that middle/high school math students need today...but not all of those functions are available on the free version. I'm sticking with this because when/if I decide to let the kids,1
"This calculator app has some great features! I might buy the full version for the polynomial, trigonometry and unit conversion features.",1
Everything you need for algebraic calculations.  Son used and was all he needed.  Even I could figure it out and its been about 30 years since I needed.,1
"I have tried several Scientific Calculator Appa for Droid and of all, I like this one the least. It is difficult to use, and the layout is confusing. Try another App before you buy this one.",0
"Worked just as described, very easy to use, nice clean design.  Looked great on samsung galaxy tablet.  1 2 3 4",1
This calculator is feature rich. The scientific and conversion calculators are helpful. The only calculations I use that are missing are financial calculations. If the programmers added that it would be the only calculator I would ever need.,1
This is the only free calculator I have found that properly handles -X squared.  Most of the free calculators will compute this as a positive number when it should be a negative number. You should read the help section or you will have a difficult. time ,1
Nifty little program to do simple calculations. I do recommend this program for simple everyday use at home or in the store.,1

THIS GAME IS SOOO ADDICTIVE. BEWARE! I PLAYED THIS GAME ALL NIGHT. I WISH I COULDVE PLAYED IT ALL DATLY TODAY BUT I HAD SCHOOL. SEVEN CRUEL HOURS OF OUR LIVES. AMEN BROTHER. AND THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO MAKE IT EIGHT. OMG!  THE ONLY WAY ANYONE WILL MA,1
Most people are down rating because its to smart for them and there is buttons they don't know but this is a perfect calculator!  I recommend this to everyone! Sure there is some &quot;extra buttons&quot; but I use them and someday you WILL too!,1
The lite version of this calculator is worthless. This has the least amount of features of any online trial version calculator. I would not buy the full version because the lite edition would not do anything that the included calculator would do. I would,0
"This installed on Android 2.1 and initially looked promising, but then embedded ads froze the app and it stopped working. This made it unusable and I uninstalled it. Also, the layout for scientific functions is on tabbed pages, making it difficult to use",0
Not challenging and not fun.  The screens never change and it is so repeatative that it is boring beyond boring.,0
this is not supposed to be a kid for teens this is for little kids and I'm tired of seeing reviews saying ti easy and boring. my five year old loves it.,1
"This game was fun until I couldn't get it to quit. it kept taking me wither to the screen to select level or it would start playing. After about 5 times selecting quit, and it not doing so I had to uninstall.",0

this game is cute but its fer younger kids. but my little brother loves it! so id say it a 5 star!,1

you have to complete all the levels in one session you can't open it then close it or you have to start at level one again it is kinda a boring app and this is on the kindle fire,0

This really brings back the classic Whack-A-Mole and it's nice that I don't have to pay at an arcade to play this. It is basically Whack-A-Mole but it is more complex because of the modes. First you choose between Classic and Endurance (A longer game) an,1

I really enjoy playing this game. It is just like the whack-a-mole at Chucky Cheese and other places. Kids and adults will have fun with this.,1
Everything runs fine on my white pandigital. This is a classic that has 3 modes btw. Try this app if your looking for a good touch screen  game,1
the kid in me just loves this.  it's nice to have a fun game to blow off steam and not have to put a lot of thought into playing.  I love that my son can sit in my lap and we can play it together.,1
"It is unacceptable that a game can't be moved to the sd card. It is cute enough, but uninstalled for wasting space. And ads.",0
This app was okay for the first few minutes then seemed boring....Maybe I'm just to old for it and this is better suited for younger,0

"I love this app! Not only does it have very specific zodiac signs (e.g. 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Gemini), but it also has horoscopes for up to two days in the past and two days into the future. I've found it very concise with what's going on in my life. There ar",1

this a great fun little app I use it and its very surprisingly true or maybe I twist what happens in reality to make it seem like that whtevr great app,1
This an app that tells you what your day is like. It is predicted by Gods. By figuring out what horoscope you are depends on what id your birthday. This app is very interesting.,1

I have a kindle fire hd 7inch and this app works really good on here I check my horoscope allot so I've tried almost every horoscope app and this one seems the most real to my life.,1
I love. it I like reading it every day . IF IT SAYS I AM going to have a bad day I try to turn it around an make it a good one.I love it.,1
For the Ppl that think their bday is not on here you have to use it right.  It is broken down into 3 cycles for each sign so u have to pick the right one.  It took me a lil bit to figure that out.  It also can give u a day or 2 ahead.),1
Works for me just fine!  I find it entertaining and often read last weeks horoscope just to see how close to reality it was.,1
I like it. I read it of a morning and think about it at night and.... I think that it is oddly close to that day. It's a nice app. Pretty cool.,1

its nice to get a glimpse at what ones future holds. I like this app because it comes pretty close to what usually comes about.,1
Stay away from this app unless you want to be in a bad mood everyday!  Everyday is negative or says have a great day because tomorrow is going to be crap!,0
I think that this is a great app very helpful in your everyday life. And good to share with friends.,1
It is easy to read and has good graphics and is easy to use. The horoscope is mostly accurate too. I love it.,1
I enjoyed this very much.  It gives you insight into what your day might be and you can avoid traps of the mind games  people play and avoid them.,1
This is a GREAT app. The horoscopes I read were amazingly appropriate for my friend and myself. I would recommend this app to all of my friends.,1

This is a great app that is both attractive and efficient. It provides a well-rounded and thorough horoscope based on a three decanate system. Highly recommended.,1
This is a great app. that makes you think about things before you do them.  At least that is what I get out of it.  For that reason I give it a five.  This is a buy...,1
"Now there is no guess work, since I got this app.  I know where I stand as the day begins!",1
I like being able to check my horoscope with more details than what I am used to because I never believed I fit into my sign.,1
sometimes these things are somewhat correct but this app seems to be right on the money.  I also like to not read it for the week then go back just to see if those things really happened. pretty cool stuff,1
I recently just started reading my horoscope with this thing and stuff yeah what yeah I really hats that you have to have a long review,1
"I love seeing what my scope is and all the people around me. It's easy to use and fun to use. Though I don't really believe what it says, sometimes it is right on the money. Then I am shocked!",1
the layout is very sexy and attractive it is very easy to navigate and the horoscopes are plausible and legitimate. these will make your day in the morning.,1
my sign is Liberia but it doesn't even have my birthday on there. it's a piece of junk. whatever you do don't by this app.,0
Great app I enjoy the interface and lay out.  Visually appealing. Easy to use and have had no problems with it.,1
I like this horoscope app a lot. it seems be be pretty accurate most of the time too. I check everyday almost,1

"I like that you can look back, or forward, to see how your day has been or what to expect. And it is beautiful, too.",1
This an awesome app for horoscopes. the daily horoscopes are enjoyable to read. most of the time they are right on point,1
This app is enjoyable to me. I check it out first thing in the morning and reread it again at night to see if it applied to my day. So far it's been right on point.,1
fun and the app tells the truth haha sorry for the people who don't like the app or it didn't work out for you......,1
"This a great application to jump start your mornings, just like your first cup of coffee. It is very informative and a lot of fun! It's better than your newspaper!!",1
I like this app. it lets you look at the horoscopes for other signs besides your own so you see who gets a better fortune. Aquarius or Aries Taurus or virgo piecies or capricorn,1
I say it is super fun to read. I love what it tell you the stuff happens most the time!!!!!,1
it tells me things I know about my self and I love it very much it shows me why I am how I am.,1
This app is fun for everyone who likes horoscopes. This particular app has 3 dimensions for you daily. I've tried lots of the other horoscope apps this one I highly recommend. Some days good some not so.,1
I really love this app. Every day horoscope is written very nicely and without crazy philosophical nonsense. It's direct and detailed.,1
my birthday and my boyfriend's are not on there theres gaps everywhere at first I thought this was made by a kid poor child Ps.I am only 11 maybe the full ape is better.,0
"Good app.  Not childish. Maybe a little more generalized than I would like, but it meets expectations.  Check this out.",1
its pretty accurate and I love the backgroud its good stuff it guessed how my day was gonna go and it was right!,1
I like the zodiac readings I try yo remember to look at it every day and sometimes it's right on target.,1
this app is really good i use it every day n its always updated. I recammend this app to anyone interested in their horoscope,1
"I am not one who loves every app. This is almost scary accurate. Hope it stays that way! Well, maybe not tomorrows.....!",1
pretty accurate and interesting my mom and I compare horoscopes every morning normally its pretty dead on. I would like more options tho. like specify love interests or careers,1
Unfortunately this would not open in my android. I wish it would have; it could  have been an entertaining app.,0
January 6 is in the second part of Capricorn ......read instructions before u rate something bad for your own short coming. Very useful and entertaining tool Thanks,1
"Interesting app.  I like how the dates are sorted in the sign, which is better than a regular horroscope.  I hate the 20 word minimum review requirement.",1
"Absolutely wonderful. Great service and highly sophisticated. Completely workable, down-packed to the fullest. I think it is easy to use and is spot on.",1
I've never had such a detailed an accurate horoscope. I love this app! It's right all the time and nothing like other ones out there!,1
I love this app for kindle fire. now I can read my horoscope when ever were ever.I highly suggest it for other people. oh and also it helps on somedays but to me they help every day with this addvice that it gives I am more successful in life.,1
"I could not be more impressed. this app is well made, never breaks, and is always there with the right information. nice work!!!",1
"I really enjoy My Horoscope, especially since I have updated this app. I like how with this app you can read the past couple days, (I like to see how accurate it was), as well as reading into the next couple of days. As I stated, I really do enjoy this a",1
"Shows multiple horoscopes; Depending on which week of the month you were born. I don't take these serious, but the first 2 were strangely accurate.",1
"I tried playing this for about 10 minutes, and then just said screw it i'm bored.  I might just not be a hardcore enough RPG'er",0
My rating is based off of the time I've spent playing this game.  Fun and addicting if you love sci0fi stuff you will enjoy this text based game.  Be warned you will get sick of this game after a while.,1
"This game is loads of fun.  You can play differently depending on your style, military, spy, trader, etc. Expect to lose some sleep.",1
Probably the best android game i have played. The dev's constantly update the game. Download the free game before paying the price for the paid game and make sure it's for you.,1
"Unable to use on old Droid X2 and forced closing a constant issue. It was suggested to go with the paid version and it performed as well as the free version. NOT AT ALL. Perhaps more hardware related, but they need to work hand in hand,",0
nothing to it has many problems you dont see anything and is hard to follow pretty much sums it up,0
I really enjoy this game. the detail into some of the thought is great. graphics are good. some things could be better like knowing which planets are what and under what faction but overall a great game. lots of options and plenty of stuff to do.  thanks,1
"i have the full premuim version of star traders. this game is absolutely fantastic if getting rich amid galactic empires is your thing. note this game has. very steep learning curve and is not easy, with harder modes even having permanent death.",1
I play the premium version. It works great on Kindle Fire HD and I have never had any problems. Game is fully functional when there is no wifi access. The developers frequently update with more content.,1
This takes me back to the days of text based rpgs. Way too much fun. I can waste hours at a time playing.,1
I love this app and planning on getting elite this is a epic app I recconmond it to all people,1
"This game is awesome. I cannot say enough good things about it. If you liked Trade Wars 2002, Outpost Trader or Planets: The Exploration of Space back in the BBS days, you will feel right at home with Star Traders RPG.",1
"Brings me back to my teens, playing TradeWars on the local WWIV BBSes.  It isn't much of a casual game, but I don't mind at all.  Most of the apps I find are short attention-span style games.  This one is one of those that you really get to spend some ti",1
"This game is better than I thought it would be, I've spent hours playing it. I'm going to get the elite version so I can get more upgrades and ships and go to more planets. This game plays smooth and fast on my Kindle Fire. I absolutely love this game.",1
Brings back fond memories of &quot;Privateer&quot;.  Not an easy game. A real game that rewards deep and continuous play.  The Trese brothers know how to do it right.  All their games are great and the elite versions are worth more than their price.  Exc,1
"Kind of reminds of that old game that's not available for (DOS) PC's anymore. Mine, sell, trade, improve. Great sim!",1
"I sign up with very specific info pertinent to each game. Either this game is malicious or they are selling users information to other people.Downloader beware, your info may be a risk with this app.",0
"Got a blank white screen/field where the pictures should have been.Some deck of HTML color reference cards!Wishing that this were compatible with all devices with Android, but it is not.",0
"this app does exactly what it says it does, gives you a quick reference card for hex codes of html colors. there's nothing on here to go wrong. its just a page with color boxes an hex codes. I'm very pleased with it",1
"It's listed as a quick reference card, and that's just what it is - quick reference. Displays swatches of color with the hex codes underneath them, with a zoom feature should you need it. I can usually figure out RGBs, it's the hex codes I have trouble w",1
I teach photography and design and this is a simple and precise color guide. It is well done and attractive.,1
I downloaded this app but i have not got the chance to use it yet. When i do i will right one.,0
this is the best app EVER! I was able to do my taxes in 10 minutes. Super convenient. Will DEFINITELY use this app again next year!!!,1
"easy to use, fast did not take any time at all to get my taxes done and got results quick",1
"THOUGHT this might really help at tax time, but after reading the other reviews about going half way through inputting your info and then being instructed to pay for more help I deleted it.  Can't even tell you how much I hate those time wasters and",0
Almost too good to be true! Only complaint was that my rebate was larger!! :) Would recommend &amp; will probably use in future.,1
"i don't like. having to pay to file taxes, but this tool does what is says and is easy to use.",1
"I input a lot of info then it wouldnt work, this is who i have been using in the past",0
I am very disappointed they are misleading and know the psychology behind claiments and use it as an advertising bonanaza. Ripoffs,0
"This app made doing my taxes so easy this year. I had used another tax program for years, and been very happy with it. When I went through that program this year the bottom line was I owed IRS over $450. I downloaded TurbTax here for free on March 31st. ",1

You have to go online and pay $79 to finish your taxes. This is a complete lie and is dishonest at best.,0
Did my taxes on this and efiled.  Loved it!  Easy to use and reliable.  I am very happy with Snaptax and with Turbotax.,1
I was surprised by how easy it was. It only took 20 minutes and most of that was looking up information I forgot to print out first.,1
"Despite the other bad review, I couldn't bring myself to believe that Intuit would  actually put a product on the Kindle app store that wouldn't work with my Fire HD. But when I installed it, I found that sure enough, the HEADLINE FEATURE of the app, whi",0
Did not recognize the camera... wanted me to enter all of the forms manually... so why would I need this?,0

"My friend used this App on my Kindle to prepare their taxes.  I haven't used it myself but it must have been a good addition because she got close to 2,000.00 return.  This was using the free version.",1
"great app! the only issue i had is one of my W-4 forms was more in the landscape mode and i couldn;t just snap a pic, but it walks you through everything for easy manual entry. easy and fast!",1
I had no problems. Pretty straightforward and easy to use. I filed today before 9:50 pm PST. Awesome deal for 14.99.,1
beautifully executed bait and switch. after you enter a ton of info it claims your return is too complicated for the android app and offers to transfer said info to the paid app. of course you go for it because you don't want to start all over. what is s,0
"I cannot say how baf it is when a game does not have an actual quit, but only allows you to  press the home button to end it. Bad. Bad. Bad. Who knows what it does when you leave that way.  Also, this game is slow between &rdquo; shots&rdquo;.",0
"I can't believe this game doesn't have more 5 star reviews. its a lot of fun, I like it and my kids do too. Definitely worth playing.",1
"I downloaded it, tried it and deleted it. I'd prefer a mini-golf or actual golf game. This is just silly.",0
"lol, more fun than I thought this would be.  I'll be trying to get a real life game of this going around the office on Monday. Well done devs.",1
"This is both hilarious and fun! I can see it may get old quickly, but I am enjoying it now.",1
where is the exit button?  the app doesn't exit. need to force stop. otherwise its an ok game for free.,0
I adore this game. My son and I laugh out loud trying different angles to improve our scores. Don't  miss this one.,1
"Kindle Fire review - Read the reviews and listen to the ones who have actually played the game.  Good graphics, great concept.  Controls work fine.  Certainly not an easy game, but then where would be the fun in that?  Normally I would give this four sta",1

"Loads to a black screen, vibrates once, vibrates once more, then the app quits. I tried twice but the results are the same on Samsung Intercept.",0
"this game is really fun!  it's definitely worth trying. and I love the guy when you get him to the target, really funny",1
I got this app and it didn't even load I got it for my daughter and she liked it but she couldn't figure it out,0
"no exit button on menu, and back button doesn't exit... have to hit home and go to task manager to actually quit... poor programming IMO",0
"The style and feel of the game creates a fun/playful atmosphere that is very appealing. The animations of the characters, design of the cubicle and general gameplay just.marks it as a wonderful game.I definitely reccomend it!!",1
"works real great on paper, or real life...but not in a game. sorry.maybe there was better physics? trashcan will never stop this momentum.",0
"If you have a Kindle Fire, then it is pretty fun and addicting to me, but if you have an ipod, or iphone this game can be pretty hard to play on a small device.",1
"sux.however, cubicle golf in the real world is amazing!!!  great idea!!!  thanks!the app is very repetitive and boring.",0
Not really golf. It is some slacker employee scooting around the office trying to avoid the boss (the obstacle) and get into a certain area as the hole. It is interesting and the comments that the employee and the boss say are pretty silly. I would actua,1
"You might want to review the section of Android Development Fundamentals 101 about closing the app. Back button and Menu do nothing, and there's no entry to quit. Without a task killer there would be no way to close this mess of a game. Uninstalled.",0
Doesn't launch in ICS. Only gets a garbled display and background noise. Needs to be fixed so that people with new devices can use it.,0
"Works great on kindle fire.  As a cubicle dweller, i find this app hilarious.  Nice Lumberburg lines with the boss.",1
Just another boring golf game. Nothing stabs out and nothing special enough to warrant purchasing. Piss on this one and don't pay it any mind,0
This game is seriously fun. It's a challenging and interesting take on golf. Sure the boss is annoying but that's what obstacles are supposed to be.  I could do without the commentator's bad accent though! Gotta turn him off.,1
"Downloaded it thinking it would be a fun game to play.  Unfortunately it wouldn't even get past the splash screen.  I do appreciate that the only permission required is to prevent the phone from sleeping.  Might try it again in the future, and if so, I w",0

I love the app for all the bibles versions you have available. I've tried several and all were very pleasing. The highlighting and underline capabilities make it easy to remember and locate certain scriptures you want to keep in minding certain chapters.,1

I like the fact that I can read it at anytime throughout the day. It is in an easily understood language,1
I think this book is good in the way about how it uses the words that the people used then. I recommend this book for most religions,1
I use this every Sunday in church on my Google Nexus 7 tablet. Real easy to use and quick to find verses. I don't use the note take though because it does not have an &#34;undo&#34; function. That's the only negative I've found thus far.,1

Not what I was looking for.  There was some thing about this that I did not like and did not work well for me,1

"This game was a lot of fun, great graphics. I downloaded the free version so it stopped after a few different levels but it was still pretty cool",1
Same shots over and over.  No challenge.  Do not recommend it even for beginners.  Would recommend that other golf games be played.,0
Its totally a waste of time. I'm gonna delete it like now. At least its free anyway. This game stinks. DO NOT INSTALL. STAY AWAYRT,0
This game would have been bad in 1985 much less today.  Teh graphics stink and the play is awkward.  It is far outdated.  I wish there was a better golf app for my kindle fire than this.,0

"Does not affect any dogs in my neighborhood,  so it is a waste of memory space on my device! Do not get this waste of time and space!",0
let me summarize the reviews for you: this app is garbage. I didnt even have to try it to know that...,0
I tried to use this on my dog and he just sat on my sisters lap and licked her hand. Terrible app. Don't get.,0
downloaded it to see if it would work on my dog and nope. a complete waste of time and memory on my phone.,0
"Just like every one else, the stupid whistle would not shut up so I had to uninstall while it was blaring. Also, my dog had no response. I had this on my phone for about two minutes before the whistle got stuck.",0
"I have no recollection of ever having installed this app on my phone, though I am sure I did at some time.",0
this app stinks I held it up to my ear and it hurt my ear really bad and my dog didn't wake up at all I had to call her to wake up,0
Love it! You can change the frequencies and experiment! Nice job! My dog's ears perked right up. I had heard that teenagers could hear frequencies adults can't and this app proves it! Fun!,1
My dog hates this but I love it. Helps him behave when he is not. What more is there to say!,1
i hot this app and looked at how terrible the reviews are but then i looked at this one review and it said at 18000 its awesome and i got it and it was awesome,1
what is this junk?! I held the speaker on my kindle fire right up to my dogs ears and she didn't even respond..... at all!!! I would have better luck getting a dog to roll over if I shot it down a hill. My mouth would work better than this. Looking to an,0
I like messin with frends and gettin chased and jumped its all worth it so yea so yea and yea,1
it didn't call my dog it just freaked him out . but I'm not one to talk it may not be the app it may be the dog,0
Used it to train our dogs to limit their barking.  We would yell go home (meaning get back in the house and shut up) give a single toot on this horn and now they come in straight away without the whistle.,1
does not work at all my aunts dog just sat there and was like &quot;whacha dooooin&quot; like he always does! he is sorta clueless but cute,0
"My dog heard it and looked up, but he stopped caring after 2 seconds. Oh and turning it off? Yeah that doesn't work. you have to turn your media volume all the way down or restart your phone. ATK didn't kill it either it wasn't even listed. I killed all ",0
I got it out of curiosity to see how it would effect my animals they seemd to prop up their ears at first but then it was ignored.,0
"I really have no use for this other than to see who can hear it and who can't... as well as to really pester some of my close friends,but it's neat to see how high the pitch can go before you can't hear it, but please, show a little restraint when playin",1
This app annoys young kids and dogs perfectly. There really isn't much else to say. You can shift through Hz and produce the perfect pitch to piss off anyone.,1
"Great because it works, bad because it hurts the dog's ears so you probably wont use it anyway. I had to give it five stars though because technically it does work, its just cruel to the dog.",1
I really love this app dispite the fact it don't do it's job with the dog part. But it does work as a great prank....I remember when my classmate used this app in class....everyone was like &quot;What on earth is that sound?!&quot; It's more of an app to,1

"this app gives me a headache,  #3 really..... i dnt really like it.... btw. i tried it on a dog... it didnt work",0
my kindle froze with a constant buzzzzzzzz and my speakers kept popping! do not get. I had. 2 reboot and delete as soon as I opened it!!!@,0
"I dowloaded this the first time I tried it my speakers poping a lot even with no sound on, until I restarted my kindle fire.  I think that it could cause damage to the speakers.  No stars",0
"Awful garbage heap of an app. Had to see how bad it was, and it's just pure suck. I advise against it.",0
"I tested this out on my dog an  he didn't even notice  it. Horrible. Plus a dog whistle is supposed to be where only a dog can hear it, so why can I hear it too? Wierd order of pitches. don't get this app",0
My wife installed this junk on her phone and started it.  It was so piercing and loud it hurt everyones hearing.  and heres the bonus: It wouldnt exit when she tried to stop it.  We had to shut her phone down to get it to stop.Avoid this app at all costs,0
my sister uses it on my niece an I . we both hate it! works great on cats but not so much on my dog. DONT GET IT!,0
my dog was asleep I put it on high Hz she jumped up it was.great! idk others say it don't work I.disagree,1
"did not effect the dogs was a waste of money,  hurt my ears.... would not recommend to buy or use.  Bla bla bla",0
I would like to know how I can get paid to write idiotic five star reviews for POS apps that don't do anything except take your private information.  Give me 100 bucks and I will tell you this app allows you to fly to the moon!!!!,0
"at least it didnt work on my dogs, they acted like the never heard anything at all. its not worth the download",0
I don't have this for my kindle but I used to have ot for my ipod. u have to change the sound a bit to where u cannot hear it. try it on a dog. I tried it on my dogs and they went beserk. it was kinda funny. they were barked their heads off and jumping a,1
The only thing it works on is.. well nothing. Not sure what I was expecting but this was a flop.,0
did not work on my dogs (12) chihuhua's . i tried all differant frequencies and volumes - it did not phase them.,0
So after reading all the reviews of this app I have decided NOT to download it. Thank you to everyone for the info.,0

This is a pretty neat app. I wish it would go down to as low as 14 hertz. I would like to experiment with using the 14 to 16 hertz frequency as a healing tool. I wonder if any of these frequencies could be used as a rife machine. If you are unfamiliar wi,1
this app is sooo cool. I love how it drives my dogs crazy! I think u should get the app it is the bomb digity!,1
This is so fun to use to annoy the cats! Dogs didn't move but it turned my cats into Battle Cats!,1
so i though to myself oh this would be a perfect way to train my dog...... it wasn't it hurt her ears (mine too) and she ran away........... so that's WHY YOU NEVER GET THIS CRAP,0
I don't even have a dog. I can hear the whistle though. I thought the point of a dog whistle was that only dogs can hear it.,0
"you shouldnt even be allowed to publish this, let alone give it away for free...shame on you.  rating u on google app market next...",0
i friend wanted to try it out n its sooo annoyin wen she plays wit it she does it rite to my ear n its soooo annoying it,0

"My dog did not even raise a ear. Tried all settings.....nothing. I think its a joke myself. Stinks, hate it.",0
"Dogs don't react to it at all. Now I can understand it with the older dog...she is pretty deaf. But the younger dogs are in their prime and don't seem to hear it either. Giving the benefit of the doubt, it may be that you need a better speaker than comes",0
"This app drives my dog crazy, he just can't seem to understand where the sound is coming from. It's fun to watch and a good way to get his attention.",0
nothing good to say. I thought maybe i could use this with my dogs. it does not work and takes up memory on my device.,0
the first time i opened it and used it it got stuck in the on position and i had to remove my battery to make it stop...closing the app didnt stop the noise,0
even for free it was a waste. when i changed the volume it never stayed the same. plus it wouldn't stop ringing annoyingly even after i deinstalled so to whoever has a kfire i warn stay away from this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
This app is so crappy it has to be someone's idea of a bad joke. Don't even waste your time.,0
Tried this with my dogs... the corgi completely ignored it and the Pom just lokked at me... was it the whistle or that he wanted a treat?,0

"The app gets stuck and continues to whistle until you force close the app. Also, the people that say this works are wrong. Dogs respond to ANY sounds. Buy a real dog whistle and you'll see the difference. Complete garbage and horrible programming.",0
"Freaked my dog out for a bit, then he just wanted to attack my Kindle.  Maybe I will wander around the neighborhood & try it out :D",1
"People amuse me! They get on here to rate the app. They complain about it &amp; tell the developer to fix it. On the install page, towards the bottom, (you might have to scroll down), you'll find an email address that you can use to ACTUALLY get in touch",0
I got this on my kindle fire and it was terrible. the first time I tried to use it my dog didn't even look at me. don't waste your time on this app.,0
If you feel your dog is losing hearing this is a greatapp not only to access the dogs level of hearing butan excellent tool to work with a dog that is sufferingfrom any amount of hearing loss.As an example my dog does not hear people coming up frombehind,1

"My Rat Terrier is clicker trained and some time can't hear the clicker. I turn this whistle on and he comes running quickly, I makes me laugh.",1
I just tested it on my room mate... OMG!!! she was looking around trying to figure out what she was hearing. she checked the Tv... looked more... I love this app!!!!! Though I am sure she will kill me if she ever finds out it was this app.,1
"If someone made an app for watching paint dry, Pocket Ants would appear on the list of suggestions.  And no, it doesn't look good.  The developer doesn't know how to write code based on screen geometry.  Consequently it looks ridiculous on a large screen",0

"Just reading the description for this makes my skin crawl! Not the ants, but the perverse ""pleasure"" the developer must have had in making this. These people have some serious issues of their own. ""...electrocute and drown the ants; blow the ants into yo",0
This app is a waste of space. The interface is colorful but the lack of game objective makes it worthless. There is no visible mean to turn off the volume so the app stars at full blast. Not worth the &quot;free&quot; price.,0
"So, the game lets you kill virtual ants, and lots of them. Is there a goal? Nope. A point? Also nope. An interesting 2 minute diversion, but it probably won&apos;t hold your interest any longer than that.",0
"Normally I'm all for pointless things, but this gets old quick. Download it if it's free, but don't let it take up your memory space for too long.",0
"Basically its a sandbox, after 5 minutes you will never open the app again. Maybe for two year olds? Not even worth the free app of the day download.",0
"Right now this app is the alternative to Pocket God but soon, I don't know when, but soon Pocket God is coming to android and kindle fire.",0
I know they're just pretend ants but it makes me sad that you're supposed to kill them. I was disappointed by the lack of helpful instructions. Was hoping for something better.,0
"There is an ant hill and there are all sorts of things you can do (anything you thought of as a kid, plus more like lasers and freeze rays) to the ants.  There is no point.  There is no score.  You just do stuff and see how the ants respond to it.In othe",0

"This app works wonderfully. All those others who gave it a bad review must not have even tried it. Overnight my phone used zero percent battery. It was at 65% when I went to bed, and when I just now got up. Love this app.",1
"Android can manage your memory much more effectively than any task killer can. You should definitely avoid this application, and all other task killers.",0
No point of even having this... Total waste of space for newer android phones. How do these poorly written apps even make it on to the market?,0
I use it all the time. It is a real life saver for people who use their phone alot. Speeds my phone up and keeps it in tip top shape..,1

"Google has designed the Android operating system to do these functions automatically.  Using a program like this may slow your phone, cause extra drain on your battery and require phone reset to uninstall.",0
I wish I could give this app a zero star rating. Utterly useless. I can not believe Amazon is promoting this app.,0
You should avoid task killers at all costs. They actually impede on Android and REDUCE battery life. Hoping for a ban on them someday.,0
doesn&apos;t do anything I can&apos;t already do with the operating system itself. would not recommend this app to anyone. do not download.,0

This is the best music app. Requires Internet.has many artists like rihanna eminem jay z. Not really any rock bands,1
"we have this channel on our roku streaming device and we love this music channel, we all get to listen to all of our favorite music",1
Sometimes youTube wont let me watch on my phone but VEVO allllllllways does! Heck yea! And it has all the new stuff!,1
"works amazing on my kindle fire. if you want to watch/listen to your favorite music artist then this app is for you. plus its free, so what more could you ask for.",1
You can get any music video in the world and on the website! This is so cool to finally be able to watch music videos at a resturant!,1
I enjoy being able to watch music videos for some of the songs I like.  I also like the fact that you are able to search for what you likes and the  wide selection available.,1
"If you love to watch music videos at your leisure, you must have this app.  I love VEVO--lots of videos (many times UNCUT), just a finger-tap away.",1
My tablet alert me of a virus with this so. I had to get rid of this.,0
This is a must have app for anyone that wants to watch music videos. The video quality is amazing and you can save playlists.,1
I really live this app. This is my go to music app. I can pick the songs/videos I want to see and add them to my playlist and it is free. Love that.,1
I thought this app would be great and it was finnaly one that i would love it worked for abot 20 minutes and suddenly stopped working so i had to delete it,0

vevo always has the songs you want to hear! browse through some top songs now or some older classics! i love vevo app!,1
This app is the best app if you love music videos!  it's always up to date with the latest premieres!,1
It does just what it says so you do not have to worry about going on YouTube and then having to connect to vevo,1
Dont even remember this so it was not good I would guess.  Other wise wouldnt I have remembered it? :(,0
"I find the colour, clarity and quality to be excellent and so easy to access... even my 6 year old granddaughter loves it and can access it on her own!",1

I am really enjoying watching the music videos. There are some songs that just have audio which are labeled as such. This app is really good and I enjoy sharing my favorites on Pinterest and Facebook.,1
I very much enjoy watching music videos from my favorite singers.There are many videos to chose from as well as artists.,1

I recommend this app to anybody who likes music videos you can browse all kinds of categories within the app very good app I get this five stars five funds up for a good app.,1
it does not work well at all on a kindle fire. don't waste your time. I love vevo but this version ain't working.  please fix and I will change to 5 stars easy,0
This app is amazing! it works very well and the videos are all HD even if you dont have the best internet. Its great!,1
Love anything free. My kids love it because they get to see all the new releases.  I like it also I can watch all my favorite singers when ever I want.  And it a whole lot easier to use then the VH1 on the DTV4 loader.,1
works great on my kindle fire :) way better than youtube. haven't had any problems with it. videos load quickly and play without having to stop and reload. A+,1
must have if you like music videos. has great play lists and new music before it hits youtube. better than youtube,1
My on &#34; hooked&#34; me up to VEVO. I spent mot of my time in rehab listening and watching the video.,1
this app is so confusing I can not make heads nor tails on how to use it.  it is useless and not useable.,0

i love this and enjoy for hours of entertainment. the search engine is very easy to use and i enjoy just about any music videos there is to take me back to old days yesssss!!!,1
"i like watching music videos on this app, it also found me new songs to listen to. i like it",1
Vevo works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. This app makes downloading music videos a breeze. Very similar to you tube except this is for music videos only. I love it and would highly recommend it. This app is another must have!!,1
"The picture quality was horrible. I couldn't even see peoples faces, because the videos were so pixelated. This is a really bad product.",0
Easy to use Vevo music video app. Be able to view your favorite music videos on your tablet for free.,1
"This is a great app! I love it, because you can watch music videos for free, in HD without having to download them!",1
would never let me on there,0
This is great! I absolutely love it. The quality of the videos are very sharp and clear. The sound is outstanding.There is absolutely no comparison! It works perfectly with my Kindle HD.,1
i didnt like this at all....couldnt really use it the way i would youtube......i would recommend youtube to anyone who wants to watch music videos.....,0
"This is cool to be able to watch music videos that my kind of stuff,  i hope that kindle fire have some more good apps",1
I am so happy to find a station with videos in it. and Free is my cup of tea....Thanx y'all for the good things you do.,1
I love it and it keeps me up to date on the new and old music and video's have it on my ipod also.,1
vevo is messed up because whenever you start listening to music and watching it says vevo isn't responding so you have to exit out,0
"It's a great app. If you want to listen to your favorite singer or band, get this app. It's a great app and it's free",1
"You name the genre of music you like and make a video playlist.  The video qualty is great for most videos, and you can fine tune the videos to your taste or just start the videos playing and VEVO will keep the videos coming in the genre you adore.  Must",1
This works as well on Kindle Fire HDX as it did on IPad. The updates have really improved speed and efficiency.I use it much more because it's now very user friendly with great picture quality.,1

"This app. is amazing you don't have to go through the trouble of downloading your own music, its all there and you get to watch the music videos!",1
"This app sucks! It Plays videos fine but first it forces you to post every little thing you are listening to facebook if you want to be able to create a playlist. Why do these companies Apple, &amp; Tootle &amp; Aneroid Have to have to try to know as muc",0
I myself do not like Google or anything there about. That is one of the main reasons I like Vevo so much. It just needs that extra push to get it more popular! Love it though. Keep it up!,1
The choices of music just weren't for me-more for the younger generation. It was a good variety of artists though.,0
"When Vevo first appeared as an app on my Roku, I started compiling histories, for playlists, of my favorite videos.  Then I discovered a Lebanese video by Myriam Fares, then another.  I emailed Vevo to tell them Hey, I'd pay a little for something like t",1
"terrible unreliability on the Kindle,  crashed constantly. that problem is exacerbated by vevo blocking users from viewing their videos through youtube on mobile devices",0
"So much better than Pandora! You can watch ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can pick a genre, from gospel 2 metal. u can do anything!!!!!!",1
I love the vevo music videos on YouTube but this app is terrible. It only has a small number of the videos that they have posted on YouTube. Also it takes forever to load and the app design is not very user friendly. Not reccomended.,0
I was excited when I saw there was a VEVO app but the video quality is extremely poor.  I'm not sure if these videos just look that way anyway or if it's just because of my Kindle Fire HD...,0
Why am I being foreced to write words? If I have nothing to say then why do I need to type? This is very annoying.,0
OMG! I love the fact that you can create your own VIDEO playlist. You can listen to videos over and over and over again! There is a variety of music from KORN to Una. Thrilled I can use and the cost is free. Cant get much better than that! I would defini,1
"This app is good to have so you can log in, set your fav's and watch the music videos you want when you want and without having to upgrade to anything.",1
My step-daughters love this app....they watch music videos all the time. They also love their Kindle Fires. Amazon is awesome.,1
When traveling with my granddaughters (15 & 4 yrs old) it keeps them occopied.  They are in different age bracket but both can enjoy it.,1
VEVO - Watch Free Music Videos  allows you to watch a whole bunch of GREAt videos on your Kindle Fire.,1
"This App is my favorite.  Whether I want to listen to an entire album or a particular song, it's all there. Plus, new albums just out are on there too and I can decide whether I want purchase it or not.  You can even program it to play a set of your favo",1
I tried to get on a music video and it was freaking me out it was like the worst horror movie evermore thank goodness for this app now I don't have to get scared out of my mind.,1
"What can I say but thank you very much, since I found this app on my Kindle Fire HD that's pretty much where it stays Just  like Pandora for music but with never ending playing music videos that learn what you like. SWEET.",1
i luv this app its like so kewl.i tried it on meh friends phone and its kewl.u guys should get this im 12 and i &lt;3 it!!!!! : ),1
"but then it started deleting my playlists, then it started taking forever to load a video and then it just stopped working completely.... so not worth the hassel!-",0
The ads would load the stop at 1 at every video. This app is stupid. Vevo please fix this crappy app.,0
"So, more than likely you won't be able to use this on any school/college exam due to be on a smartphone, but if you could it would work great.  Easy to read and calculates everything I can throw at it.",1
"I am not qualified to evaluate this app, but it seems like it would calculate anything.  Works on my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation.",1

This is very impressive. RPN has been a preference of mine.  I find it difficult to write anything that wasn't already written by Thom Bone.  Fantastic app on the Kindle. I do miss real buttons.,1

This app has been able to handle everything ive thrown at it. I believe it's on track to replace my old calculator.,1
I saw it in the apps and didnt believe it could do so many things. It does and much more. This is one application that everyone should have in their Kindle. Amazon should have it installed in the Kindle without having to purchase it.,1
"It does what it says, turning my tablet into an HP with reverse polar notation.  Very crisp keys, nice response, changes from landscape to portrait seamlessly.  As someone who cut my teeth with programmable calculators in the final years before PC's came",1
Calculators with these functions used to be expensive. This one does it all casual or scientific applications are all there. Interface highly intuitive. Need a calculator? Look no further.,1
It looks and works exactly as the original HP calculator.I am very happy of having purchase and installed this application,1

"I once built a Heathkit calculator, that used reverse polish notation,  so I purchased this app just to see if it was similar.  Haven't delved into all the different things it offers, but then I don't deal with statistics very much.",1

My grand daughter loves this app. She played with it all day after unloaded it on. Whenever she sees my kindle she says game...game....and points to the Santa app,1

I enjoyed this app and it is a welcome edition to my kindle fire.I would reccomend this app for a reference on your tablet.,1
Word of the day helps expand your vocabulary.  Excellent tool for learning Spanish. I would definitely recommend to a friend.,1

This is an excellent shopping list that allows full addition of items including price. You can just select from a list for needed items and add in the quantity. As you check off items it asks for price and gives a total for purchases.The only drawback is,1
Wasn't what I was looking for.  Too much set up time and too tedious.  Just want something with a list.,0
I took it off.  It was not easy to use as advertised. Much to complicated to set up; not intuitive;  directions were NOT helpful.,0

I would love to make beautiful fractal art like what is shown to get you to get the app. I can't make it do anything! There is not instruction manual or in app direction whatsoever. Don't get this app.,0
okay first of all I could not use the app because when I open there is a note saying something about David Byrne. DO Not get this app.,0

I don't know if you have to be a math wizard to make these beautiful fractals or not...I'm not.  All I can do is make blobs.  I would love to make pretty ones and save them...wish there was a tutorial and/or drag with stylus/finger to create new images. ,0

This is a fun app and great for sharing! Also an interesting way to introduce beautiful math. We've made some interesting personalized images. Thanks!,1
This app as the other person put it is frackin fantastic!!!!!Its so frackin addicting!If your are a creative person or just want to try it out this app is for you!!!!!I highly recommend fractoid!!:D,1
Use of menu to change math and options makes easy to use. I quickly found a design that is appealing for my wallpaper.,1

This is such a cute game and its fun to pass the time with. You tilt your screen (Kindle Fire for me)  to control the little guy.  Really fun game for me!,1
My kids and I love this game easy to play for the novice but gradually more challenging for the expert. The music does get a little annoying however but how many other games are too? Fun to play and well worth the price.,1
This app does not need to access my phone state or information about my networks. No thanks. HTC Thunderbolt stock rooted.,0
"I have no idea how to play this game.  Where are the instructions?  Just a waste of my time trying to figure it out.  Have lots of games I play all the time, will not bother with this one.",0

there is no reason for the amount of intrusion this &quot;game&quot; has. reading my phone state has no logical reason for any game..,0

I love that this app is so flexible.  My DD is learning the times tables so we can adjust it for just the table she's learning that week.  We've got a rule that before she plays any other games she has to do at least 2 sets of flash cards.  No complaints,1

These flash cards are great review for my 3rd grader.  Especially handy when have to wait in the doctor's office.  He has fun and is learning at the same time!  Also a great introduction to math for my preschooler.,1
Enjoy playing the game.  It is a good way to learn the strategy of the game.Both my Husband and I enjoy the game.,1
This is a great way to break up the day or to grab when you only have a few minutes. I play it daily,1

Even better that it's free. I love euchre even if I do have to play against the computer :). I can play anytime anywhere & I can stop anytime & pick up right where I left off. Good game. No frills just plain cards & plain euchre.,1
I have always loved euchre and this is a great game with no ads.  I like that I can change the player names and also the challenge of play.,1
"This is by far the best euchre program I have ever used. The opponents are good players, and don't cheat.I spend WAY too much time playing.",1
fun game - play it all the time - just what I wanted to get - enjoy it lots -,1
This app is perfect if you love to play euchre fast and with the computer as opponents. I love that you can change the names and settings easily. Great app! I have played daily for months.,1
There were no instructions whatsoever on how to play this game.  I had no idea what do or what the scoring meant.,0
I love playing this game.  I played it for many years and had a great time.  I played in tournaments and it was a fast paced and fun game.  The fact that you have a partner is fantastic because it helps with making you points.  This game is wonderful for,1

"Besides loving the game of Euchre anyway, this game app is easy to play. No delays, very responsive!  Just wish the cards were just a bit bigger though.  Have trouble at times seeing what some cards are.",1
Not usually a card player but I do love euchre. This is realistic except the other team always seems to hold the missing 'trump' card!,1
"I have tried several of the Euchre games, this one to me is the best.  It shows everything just like you are playing for real. Other games it was hard to keep up with who was playing but this one is great",1
I love Euchre its a game i play all the time weather it be with friends and family or on my pc. I downloaded this app on my kindle hoping for it to be fun to play while i had down time or while on the go. Not very good if you are looking for a Euchre app,0
The computer AI makes it really hard to win especially when my partner is table talking with our opponents.  Although I still win. A lot... but this is only because I am an AAAAaaaaammmazinng Euchre player.,1
"Nothing seems to make sense, you can't pick it up, you can't order your partner up and I didn't find any instructions anywhere.  Maybe it's because I'm new to the kindle world and having difficulty b/c of that, but I deleted the app.",0
"I love euchre, but I have no one to play with.  The computer is my partner.  It is quite challenging.  I like this version better than others  have checked out.",1
Great game. I used to play this all the time. Now I can play it anytime without having to hunt for someone to play.,1
if they would bother to list where this is available it would save alot of people alot of time....common courtesy STILL goes a long way.,0

Been using Peapod since it started in the Chicago area I love it. Very easy to use app and I am happy I can see it on my kindle screen and not use the iPhone.,1
"Very satisfied with this easy to use and feature packed App. If you use Peapod you need this App. It's that simple. And, if you don't use Peapod, you should. Why waste time at the store when you can have your groceries delivered right to your kitchen tab",1

Very addictive app. Suitable for all ages. Works great with first generation Kindle Fire. Love the option of playing with dots or flowers/fruit. Also like being able to change the backdrop. Highly recommended!,1

KEEPS MY INTEREST BY CHALLENGING MY MIND EACH TIME I PLAY THIS GAME.  I ENJOY PLAYING.  IT HOLDS MY INTEREST AND I FIND MYSELF PLAYING BEECELLS DAILY. GREAT FUN,1
Bee Cells is a game that keeps the mind working.  Need some skill to complete this game.  This game is for the older game players.,1
This is a mindless little game which gets you thinking about things other than our everyday stresses.I I I I,1
Simply put this is a boring game. You can get similar games for free if you look.  Adding tracking software to a paid ap is a nono as far as I am concerned. Possible fake reviews are worse.  You guys get one star for this action.,0

Can't seem to stop playing. No rules or notes on how to play but once you start it is fairly easy and then it gets harder as you go. Good no brainer at first but then gets you to think stradigey,1
This app stays running in the background and has no option to exit the game properly. This is a shady practice. The game lacks a polished feel to it.,0

This game is just a waste of time. It is boring and there is not possibility to play the game and win. You get to move one ball and when you get a group of 6 they disappear. Unfortunately the game adds multiple balls for every one you move so ultimately ,0
After purchasing and enjoying the game one time I shut down my kindle and when I went to play it again it said I needed to put in a password.  I do not have a password so I was not able to play again.,0
"My newest favorite! Takes more thought than I had expected,  making it  a good challenging game. The rules are very simple & easy to play. But getting your score higher, is the fun part. I love it!!!",1
I like this game a lot.  You have to strategically fill in the cells.  It's a great challenge! I recommend it if you want to put your thinking cap on.,1

"makes me think, makes me plan moves and I enjoy playing this game.I find the challenges it offers great. Not sure I will ever win but its fun trying",1
Difficult to put down at times.  It helps with hand-eye coordination and exercising flabby gray matter:)  Try not to start a game if you are pressed for time!,1
I guess I didn't care for this game and deleted it.  I don't even remember getting it.  Maybe I should try it again.,0

Bad thing is on fire you have to press home key to exit. On my first game I got 110 points. The game doesn't take up much memory. It does everything the designer indicates.  I don't get every free app of the day.  Of the several hundred I did get some ar,1

I agree with most others on here. No exit button among other issues drives this rating way down. This game has to go.,0
It's very diffcult to play.  I am always looking for something that is quick and fun and this just wasn't the game for me.,0

"Ugh, this is too simple and too repetitive to be SO addicting... I actually HATE this game, it's the same, there's NO winning, no chance, EVER... so... I just play and play again. As soon as I lose, I start an new game.  Grrr... 5 stars for most used app",1

This game was a lot of fun and I play it often. Once you get started you do not want to quit until you complete all the levels. One draw back is if you do not pass the level you will go back to level 1. Great game for all ages.,1
"who doesnt like games like this, a lot of fun to play when you have down time and you are bored",1
This is about as good of a Arkanoid knock off as you will ever find.  I miss playing the original at the laundromat next to my first job as a teenager.  this does a fine job of recreating on my phone.,1
"Really more like Arkanoid in many ways, although I haven't found lasers yet.  Smooth, fluid, nice control system, pretty to look at...an instant classic!  Thanks so much for offering it!",1

I loved the old blocks game but the controls on the screen just do not work as good as the video game console.  too hard to keep up with the ball,0

I love this app but on my phone Sony Erricson Play it took up alot of space but on my kindle however it was amazing but a month after it took a long time to load and do people even read these things?,1

It was OK but I was expecting more...  Its hard to earn money and it won't let me use the fish tank for the backround-live-video-feed thing.,0

"Great app for all ages. You select/buy different rods to catch different kinds of fun fish. For example,  the candy cane rod catches fish relating to the Christmas holiday ie: red elf hat fish, x-mas tree fish, etc. You feed the fish and they give u coin",1
This is my stress relief. There is a rhythym to this that you can't do if you're stressed and you would think it would add to the stress but I know that I'm okay when I can do this effectively. Plus it makes me smile.,1

"This fast-paced game is highly addictive and you can even play it with ONE player.  Farkle has been around since the Renaissance period, so it is a true time-tested, very enjoyable, and addictive game for all ages!",1
never have I ever felt so challenged playing dicegood game. would highly recommend this game to family and friends.love it love it,1

Good version of Farkle. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.  Works great on Kindle fire HD.,1

I first found Farkle on Facebook and thought it was a fun dice game. I was happy to see a free version of it for my new Android tablet.This rendition of Farkle doesn't disappoint at all. From the fun themed opening screen to the smooth animations and fun,1

"Fun game, easy to use on the tablet, keeps my soon occupied during Dr visita plus it helps with math skills",1
The game cheats.  The way the game plays I should be the one winning most of the time.  But most of the time as I am getting a larger score the computer suddenly has large rolls.  The game is biased not truly based on random dice rolls.  DO NOT LIKE GAME,0
"I absolutely love Farkle Dice. I play it every day, and I win quite often which is odd for me, I'm usually not real lucky. Love it!!!!",1
This is not the same as Facebook but once you get use to it it is as just as much fun.,1

I've used this app while traveling for work. It's nice to fall asleep with in an unfamiliar hotel. lots of sound choices and works great om Moto XOOM.,1
I like it because I can have something to listen to at night besides music and the ringing in my ears. The white noise is easier to sleep to than music or the ringing in my ears.,1

"So, when I got the game, I played and got to level 18!! This game is like an online game (It is, right?) that requires no username or password, just a villain name. This inspired me to start writing a book. About villains. Anyway,  I love this game and y",1
A game like this deserves more respect I will give a few reasons why.1.The community:everyone is nice and don't act all nerdy like you would probably expect. Ukane games makes the same game in different versions to sell to a different community. (Ex. Wor,1

"If you're a wordsmith, a spiritual seeker and/or a game player... And you have a sense of humor about those things, You will love this game. Not for the religious fanatics ... Delightful, pun filled, (my favorite humor) and non-committal... 3 of my favor",1
"After a couple of days, I find myself checking in on my heroine far more than is probably healthy.  As the description says and others have reinforced, there's really not a whole lot to do, other than keep up with your hero.The game's core is its humor; ",1
I find this game to be witty and interesting. I don't have to sit there playing the game for hours. I really don't even have to run in and heal my hero when I'm alerted and I don't see it....he just runs away :)great little game for sure.,1
"its quite a fun app, all you have to do is check in every couple hours, and read his diary for a couple of laughs like&quot;11:58 Noticed a small inscription on my weapon: 'Warranty void if used against monsters'. Darn it!.I guess there's more deph to it",1

I check my hero at least once a day. After awhile of reading his diary he seems alive and real.,1

"I'm kelly76,  Thanks! I'm loving the game... It's fun and I don't have to babysit it! I would love it if you all would add me!",1
"No heavy lifting here, but the developers tell you that upfront, in fact that's the point of the game. The game consists primarily of a running diary of your character's actions and the entries are hilarious.  Lots of thought. Clever.",1
"Really its just a modern tamagotchi, but its got enough difference to make it not nearly as annoying. Honestly a great time waster.",1
This game is exactly like it should be. It does what it says it does. You should play this game.,1
Just updated this app tonight and now it won't load. 100% broken now. Please fix. I love this game. Very disappointed!,0
Very funny diary entries. When I need a quick laugh I just open this app and read about my hero. Keeps me smiling all day.,1

I am in love with this game!  it's the only game that has remained on my Kindle since I downloaded it. I check on my hero daily more than once a day but I can leave him if i need to.,1
This game is so much fun I love it would reccomend it to people who have time to play very little but I check on it up to five times a day.,1
I can't really call this a &quot;game&quot;. but whatever it is its fun. its kind of annoying that the hero doesn't always do what you say but still very entertaining.,1
"Funny wordplay, interesting game idea, though it's kind of a chore at first. Once you get past level ten things start looking better.",1
awesome game. you won't like it if you like complete control. but its cool to watch. little control over hero but can punish or encourage them. light or dark.,1
i am addicted to this game. ive made so many friends its pathetic. i havent met any at all. my god name is cattail,1
"I like this app for what it is. Really is quite funny, my hero is a coward though. He always runs from a fight.",1
I have had this game for about 6 months..it doesn't take up all of my time and not a lot of action. I love it..check up in my little hero pretty often. Works great on my DROID2.,1
"I love this game! Usually I don't like text based games at all, but I love this game anyway. I love the things your hero says, its so funny. Try it, its freeeeeeeee!",1

I know I have created to many accounts. this is an awesome game but can u be nice enough to get rid of too many regrestrations plz.,1

"most people think this game (and I use the term loosely) is boring. And they're right. But even worse, after doing nothing for a day or 2, it wants you to start paying for more nothing. Boring and Stupid",0
I know the point of this is that you don't have to do much. But I think there should  be more optional things we could do. Still I love this game and enjoy everything about it.,1
been playing with this over a month now. great time waster when your bored. works great on htc thunder bolt and moto XOOM,1

I love most everything about this game! From the other heros) es ) &amp; Gods (ess)  to the names of the monsters!  and dont forger the weapons!!,1
An odd text based game with all the fun of a mock up version of an rpg without the real effort of doing more than simple minimum.  I am &quot;The Giving Tree&quot; if you want to be friends.,1

"I love this game! It's fun to watch what your hero gets into. The writing is hilarious, love the enemies and the items found.",1
"It's strange that a game in which there is so little to do is this addicting. I find myself opening the game four and five times a day to check on my hero and see what he's doing. The diary entries and game wiki are hilarious, which is a major bonus.",1
It's fun to play and read. This app will give tons of happy cute sayings that will put a smile on your face,1
"No issues on dinc2. Strange but fun ""game"", that is entertaining but wont eat your life like an MMO. Ideabox is brilliant. :-) Looking forward to more updates.",1

"This is what happens when those pocket pets from the nineties grow up, kinda.Think of those with a lot less interaction needed. You really don't control anything but it's more for entertainment. Seemingly a parody of rpgs.",1
hilarious gameplay that pokes fun at every mmorpg in existence. combines mulitple memes and pop culture with classic puns for a rewarding experience.,1
"Funniest game ever! It isn't as demanding as other MMOs, but you'll always be playing! My Gods name is The 10th Hokage. Add me!",1

"No need to think on this game. Kind of like owning an ant farm. You watch,  and sometimes help and sometimes hinder their lives.",1
"Is it possible for something to be a time-waster that doesn't take up any time? Anyway, a unique concept executed well. You don't have to check in constantly but it does reward close attention.",1
this game requires little energy or attention but is loads of fun. I've played for one week now and love it. five stars all the way.,1
My man is kicking b**t. What more could a God ask? This is an app that doesn't steal huge amounts of time and the tongue-in-cheek comments are truly amusing.,1
"I love this game.  I don't have a lot of free time to spend on gaming, which makes this pretty much perfect.  I can check in on my hero when I have time, laugh out loud at her absurd diary entries, and let the rest take care of itself.Be aware that all t",1

"The diary entries and situations that your hero runs into are hilarious. While technically, you don't even need to do anything for them to progress, just the ability to interfere in there lives makes this game incredibly fun and funny.",1
"reading other reviews, I agree that you need to have the right personality for this game. what I especially like is how it plays for you so you can divide your attention to other tasks... or just watch a movie or something. either way, I like it.",1
I didnt like it at first but its hilarious and a lot of fun even though you truly do nothing. Reminds me of something WoW and DnD players would really enjoy. Can't get enough of it! ={D,1

This game takes the zpg genre to a new level. It's fun to watch your hero move through the world and give him or her a nudge now and then. Nicely done.,1
low maintenance app with a sense of humor that never  gets dull. I love the idea that I don't have to check  it every minute.,1
"Neat little dog type game that plays by itself, you check in on your hero when you feel like it. I find myself checking on mine several times a day. Amusing diary, opponents and items/armor. I LOVE this game!",1
"This is good for anyone with a sense of humor.  although your direct control is impossible, it is a part that helps, and reflects, what the game is.",1
This game is so easy and fun to play. I highly recommend this game for anyone. All you have to do is check up on your hero a couple of times a day!,1
"Crazy, simple and you literally do nothing!! If you have a vivid imagination and like RPGs, you will like this!!",1
"Awesome game. I don't usually go for these types of games (create an avatar, multi-player platform, etc. ) but Godville is great! As Goddess I don't have to do much... just watch my creation do my bidding. The game site is a great resource for help and j",1
"This is an excellent game.  It may be confusing at first, but you come to love it eventually.  I recommend this.",1
"I have been playing this game for months now, and I still love seeing all the references and puns in it. Wish my hero would listen more though...",1
I love the funny entries. And there's no need to do any hard quests. Just get a free account and watch the hilarity ensure! XD,1
"If you're looking for a game to kill time, this is not for you.  However, if you'd like a brief distraction that will make you chuckle and not take up very much of your time, Godville is a very unique idea that will keep you entertained over several week",1
"This is a great 'game'.. I believe in God, but really? I can't believe there are people out there who actually get offended. This is only a 'game'.. a parody at that.. I, very much, enjoy playing this. That doesn't mean that I am disgraceful to the Lord,",1

"I really enjoy this game. It's simple, casual (for me) and it's entertaining no matter when I open it. It's a novel concept in mobile gaming and well-executed.",1
A laugh a minute. Be as little or as much involved as you want. My hero does some crazy things...,1
This game is awesome. It is very original and is very funny. It seems simple at first but has more depth to it than it appears to.,1
"I really like it. the entries are cute, his reactions are priceless, and the fact that I technically don't have to do anything but sometimes revive him is great.",1
"If I was dieing on a desert island with no food or water, a weak signal and one bar, I would waste the last moments of my sad life playing Godville.",1
"Love it. Provides lots of laughs, kudos to the devs. Can't wait to see their next project. Who knew not playing a game would be so entertaining?",1
This game is entertaing and definitely worth the download. It's not hard to keep up with even if you don't check it often and full of funny updates. I highly recommend it.,1

"I'll admit, I chuckled at one of the puns...but this app is (was) a complete waste of time &amp; memory on my phone.",0
This app is great especially if you're familiar with RPGs. Definitely satirical and filled with play on words. Great great fun!,1
I can't stop looking at my hero just to see what crazy things he does next...though most of the time it's drinking. Great game for those who want the flavor of an MMO without dedicated hours of staring at at screen.,1
"I have been playing this game for months now and I still love it. keep in mind, this is not an instant gratification game. It's a check in a couple of times a day game.",1
"Loving this - keeps me laughing all day. Very witty and addictive! And the forum is great fun, too!Goddess name: Bellatrixie (or Bellatrixie The Strange, as soon as the admins get around to changing it for me)",1
I enjoy the witty comments and scenarios that your hero gets themselves into. The only think I would add is a way to make your hero smarter but I'm worried about what would happen if they used any magic.,1
I enjoy the humor and references the game has. I love that you can be as committed as you want and it just plays by itself.,1
"This game has no true game play, no real action, and no true storyline, and as far as I'm concerned, I should be hating this.  But it's AWESOME!  It's strangely addictive and fun.",1

"I've had this installed for months now, and despite the minimal interaction, it is one of the few games I won't uninstall to make space for another.Let your hero loose and watch her praise you and smite your enemies.",1
Great if you don't have much time on your hands and enjoy a quick laugh. But why is my character such a wimp?!,1
this is just genius... i mean i cant always check in on my hero everyday so this is just AMAZING. the only thing is i wish you could read what your hero did over the days or whatever time period. but other than that... GENIUS,1

This is a really cute little time waster. I like the concept and the pop references. The fact that some Xtians are whining about it is just gravy.,1

"There really isn't much more one can say about this app than the title of this review states. The ""game"", and I use the term lightly, is about on par with watching mold grow on bread. I've been more entertained watching my dog vomit up crayons.",0
Love to check up daily on this game. You can interact as much or as little as you want. Always brings a smile to my face.,1
"I have enjoyed this game like others, and, like others, I have been force closing since the update this morning. I hope the devs fix it fast so we can start enjoying it again. My humble warrior might think I've forgotten her.  Motorola Bionic.8/3/12 - Ch",1
"I love this game. There is little to do, but the content is usually hilarious. It's a zero play game, so like I said... you don't do much. You basically attempt to guide your hero while it fights monsters and builds you a temple in your name.",1
This silly little game makes me laugh every day.  I find myself randomly checking the app just to see what kind of crazy thing happens next.,1
I really love godville and I think it was a great idea because I basicly don't do any thing. Awesome,1
I have been &quot;playing&quot; Godville for months now and have really enjoyed watching and interacting with my hero. The app is constantly being improved and the execution of the concept is top notch.,1

"So the concept is get a game you don't play and then just read text. Sounds reminiscent of Commadore 64. This is a poor idea, and even poorer app. The ratings do appear to be skewed. Dev appears to be spending time writing reviews. One star and no d/l fo",0
Funny. I'll keep this one and peek at it every so often. The fundamentalists who are offended and rating the app poorly have their underwear on too tight.,1
Fun game with lots of entertaining reading that doesn't require lots of time. Great time killer. I love it. Yay!,1
"A game that I just keep going back to. You basically just set it up and let it ride, but it also offers quite a bit of interactive avenues to explore; such as gladiator fighting, guilds, and other casual fun.",1
Very addictive and competitive. Well this is a very stupid and wastes your time kind of app. but AWESOME game and love the references it make to other games. Did i mention it's also hilarious?!?! also you need to be knd of a gameer to understand the joke,1
I seen other reviews for this and they were 5 star reviews well they lied you don't have alot of options for editing unless you buy full version they need to let you know its pretty much a demo. Don't waste you time with this.,0

Beautiful for my tablet. I am a wallpaper fanatic and I love nature scenes. These are well suited for a tablet and they move. Thanks amazon!,1
I love it. Its girly but very pretty. I don't notice any battery drain. This is my favorite! Very peaceful.,1
I got this app for free but when I downloaded it to my phone it look a lot different than I though.  It looked cheesy and cheap. It is free so....,0
"Very beautiful, I don't use it because I found something better, but I really love the anime kinda look. It's worth getting.",1
I only got the free app of this live wallpaper.  It is very pretty.  I would love to see what the paid app shows but I am such a cheap skate.  The colors are very lively and the movement of the clouds are nicely done.  Enjoy!,1
I still have this on my tablet it is so beautiful and tranquil and it is best I seen on my tablet and works both long and tall if I turn tablet either way. I havnt purchased all the other that comes with it and wouldn't recommend anyone spend money to do,1
Haven't had much time to really test the wallpaper but I like what I see so far. I mostly am only writing this to remind people that this is not an app... You can't open it... You just add it like any other wallpaper.,1
"Altogether, a lovely live wallpaper - a full and glowing moon (or is that a star?) provides the landscape for a floating ephemera of violet and blue clouds. Ad-free, and works wonderfully on the Kyros!",1
This is very pretty wallpaper.  I like the options you can use with it.  It's kind of like a dream.,1
"It was a nice wallpaper while I had it, but I had seen much nicer ones for free else where",1
This is super nice I am sure after i run it for awhile and have no issues I will buy the download.,1
Perfect for me and it looks amazing on my Galaxy S phone. I'll be paying for this one.  Go Dev!,1
"This has a soothing affect to me. It's not a busy pattern, nor  is it a fast moving wallpaper that distracts from info that is on screen. I would recommend this to anyone that wants  to beautify their screen. It's awsome-to me.",1
"its wallpaper, not an app. thats why it wont open, thats why its not in your app list. its a live wallpaper so you have to enable it. its amazing that some of you dont know how to work your own device, probably because you cant/dont read",1
"I like the movement of the clouds. Serene and tranquil. Can't beat free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"A waste of money, way to confusing for me. Plus I want to play the person, not a cheat sheet.",0
anyone playing the game should get it.  it keeps you from looking in the dictionary for words to fit the letters you have.,1
I used this when I was just starting out with Scramble.  It was great!  Don't use it very much now but I always recommend newies to use this.,1
Keeps having error notice that it did not download properly. Tried several times..Not a true rating because I have not been able to install it to try...HELP :(,0
this helps me keep up with some of the other people I play with. I like how the page is clear over the board.,1
I really enjoy this game because you can have many games started at one time which you can almost always find someone to play with,1
Sure saves me time playing words with friends.  A quick and easy way to find new words.  I've had poor results copying a puzzle and pasting it on the board help though I've tried the volume down button and on/off button simultaneously.  The instructions ,1

"m.patten &amp; Annette Rider said it nicely. I used to play a lot of scrabble in the past. WwF is 'sort of' my return to Scrabble (for free :-)). Before I played words, now I am strategizing and making better placement. The app ia great and deserves its ",1
This is a great cheat app for Words With Friends. it's simple and it tells you how to use it. A must buy app.,1
It helps me when I have very little letters and get stumped on trying to find a word. Great when I had it!,1
Love this app! Every time I have contacted the developer he has responded so quickly it's unbelievable. He is quick to help and to fix the few problems I encountered. App is easy to use and very helpful when playing the game. If you do need help using th,1
I can't get this downloaded to my kindle. Went through process of  getting Adobe file but it sits in my download file and won't allow this app to launch.,0

"I would like to use it split screen, but I haven't found a way to do that. Maybe that will eventually  happen.",0
"I like this app better than Word Cheat because you can click on a word to get an instant definition. The only downside I found (maybe I haven't figured it out yet) is you can't a click a beginning or an ending letter, so you can better your search. Other",1
"i think this is one of the best help apps on the market,any one who needs a little help should at least give it a try even if they are not big on asking for help. however it is terribly difficult to get to word.",1
When purchased I thought this was a game. Please cancel. A detailed description or a demo screen could prevent the need to cancel soon after placing order.,0
We enjoy playing game and talking with friends when they call to ask where did we come up with that word to win.,1
"I love this app, It is an amazing helper for &quot;Words With Friends&quot;! I wish I had this for &quot;Scrabble&quot;:) Thanks Dev!",1
don't write a review if you never used the product. sometimes people need assistance when playing a word. there are beginners out there who are not as good with words or spelling and it provides th assistance needed for them.,1
It is such a help even if it's cheating. Some words I do know but could not see them with the letters jumbled.,1
"I downloaded word help for when I got in a bind and couldn't find a word but I am so addicted to using it I use it all the time. Not a good thing because I don't try to find words on my own anymore, but it works better than the online help I was using. S",1
"I'm hooked. I must do this every morning when I wake up, and every night before I can go to bed!",1
Yeah yeah I know I'm a cheater but who cares...it's all about the win baby....This app has helped me win a few games but it doesn't guarantee a win.  If you are looking for some help then download it.,1
really comes in handy on word games....all sorts of words to choose from and many various ways to use this tool,1
Now  all ways winning my games. Loving it. It is pretty cool how it can tell u amaZing words. Awesome,1

there is a free version of this that really doesn't suck. that way youu can be a cheater and a tight wad,0
Impossible to use. Waste of money.  I thought it would be a nice assist but it was no help at all,0
i have never been good with word games. i put in my ideas and if they don't Work this app helps me see what and where i should play. i honestly use it to learn the game and if someone really is that much better then me. i don't care to much for the game ,1

"Very unfriendly, can see how it is use and can't switch between Word for Friends and Word help easily.  That was a waster..",0
I enjoy playing games and think this is a great help to Words with Friends.  I use it every day.,1
Love it so much.  It unscrambles your letters and offers more word choices. Works great on my Kindle Fire HD reader.,1
I only use it against others that use cheats! You can tell who's using a cheat program or not. I prefer not to use it.,1
"I love this app, it helps me so much.  I don't use it to cheat, just to help me find a word.",1
"Works great for the occasional stump!For those who don't like it... don't use itStop rating low just because you doing like others using the app. This may be 'cheating' as you see it, but you're just being ignorant and rude",1
This program only worked when it felt like it.  It would not retain words that had been entered & I had to start from scratch more than once on the same game.  Uninstalled it.,0
It works perfectly on my Kindle fire. I love to use it when I'm stuck and need to get rid of those letters that never seem to make a common word!It also supplies you with the definition so you can actually know what that odd word means. It's fun to use a,1
"Sorry, but I have not learned to use this game.  I thought it would lend me a hand in Words With Friends, but I haven't been able to figure it out and can't use it.",0
I love this app it helps me so much. My scrabble dictionary is hard to read and I can never find good words.  With this I can easily find words that fit.  Works well in my kindle fire.,1
I find it difficult to use and am still working on itIf its not quick and easy it is not worth it.,1
Love this app.  I play Workds with Friends everyday and use this all the time.  Great app for those who need help.,1

"This is for cheaters. I cant see why any decent person would cheat when playing with friends. If you must, than cheat. but don't expect to feel good about yourself.",0
Not easy to use or figure out. Just don't buy into it there is no refund and sorry to say much regret.,0
This app has a lot of features that other apps don't.  You can see your search app over top of the game so you can do searches without switching back and forth between programs.  It never fails to find a word for me.  I love it!!!,1

this is a great tool to have. Not only am I learning words I could never think of on my own I am now able to spell somewhat better and have been able to use them in my normal speach. although some dont know what I am talking about lol.,1
I used to spend hours on one move because I couldn't find a word that fit! that's not the case anymore! works perfectly with the kindle fire!!!,1

I play with friends and am glad I can now do this on my kindle fire hd.  I like that I can carry it with me wherever I go.  It is easy and fun to play.,1
Little to none on instructions. No place to inquire. Help is potion much else to say bad bad bad bad,0
What help this app is when playing Words with Friends. I love playing but sometimes get stuck so this helps,1
I can not get this app to work.  I've already wasted too much time trying to figure it out. No matter what I click on I can't get anything to appear nor any help with what or how!!,0
A great app to help with playing Words With Friends.  It gives you many options to play and check your selections.,1
"My son tells me it's cheating but I don't mind. I use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm pushing 60 so I need a little help now and again. Besides, it's only as good as your tiles. If you have 4 E's, an X, and a W, and there's no tiles left to play, it is what",1
"When words with friends is up and working it is a big help. Right now my app is not working on my kindle which is useful,driving me crazy",1
is absolutley not compatible with kindle fire.  works nicely with your. android phone.  you need screen shots and kindle fire does not have that ability,0
"I need something that will connect to the game I am playing.Having the option of creating a word from letters available andswitching to another screen is time consuming, frustrating, andnot my ideat of HELP.",0
"Did not find the app helpful at all.  Not user friendly, and I especially did not like having to re-create the boards.  The in-game feature did not work.  Complete waste.",0
"I have tried this several times, especially yesterday with Words with Friends, I have been looking for something like this for some time.",1
I have really enjoyed playing this game.  It is easy to learn and you can play with several friends at once.  Just be careful who you play with because they may have cheat sheets available.  I didn't like to learn you can download an app that chooses you,1
I've had this app for some time and it woked great.  The hardest part was trying to figure out how to take a screenshot with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Then on Feb 26 Words with Friends pushed out an update changing WWF to landscape mode and WHFF could no l,1
"but the first time I clicked on it, it did say .99 cents. first time it ever happened to me in 4-5 months. hit my 'back' button on my phone, tried it again, and it was free! so if it ever happens to you, try again! and wait a good half hour after 12pst! ",1
A little frustrating at times and infuriating but in a good way. Graphics are well done and the puzzles ingenius.,1
It's a generic puzzle game like the thousands that have come before it. Not entirely fun and would not recommend to anyone.,0

"Some people have no patience with waiting until a free app is converted to free.Anyway pretty fun game, barely tried it but going back after this review.Amazon please create an IQ test for people before they can do reviews, just a thought.",1
I love this game. It is a logic puzzler (?)  forces you to plan ahead several steps and avoid trapping yourself. Simple execution but intriguing and challenging. If you like Quell you will like this. I don't have issues with the controls on my evo.,1
like others have said.. we've seen this puzzle a hundred times in different forms... takes 3 seconds to solve in your head... but 30 seconds to actually manoeuvre.worse... can't move to SD.Uninstalled.,0
Would have been well worth the 99&cent; if it weren't free today. I like thinking games like this. Similar to aporkalips.,1
"nice game, simple controls, works well on my htc evo. good time waster. can't comment on sound, as I always leave those off. doesn't need a ton of permissions which should make those people who worry happy :)",1
"We  have had it for over a year now, illuminating the dark places, and it works great.  Recommend it highly.",1
I chose the five star rating because the ease of download and use for this app is excellent. I keep it charged in preparation of black- outs. It is an excellent tool.,1
"I find that I frequently use my phones as flashlights.  With my HTC Thunderbolt, it was preinstalled.  I am using this app for my Amazon FireKindle Fire, Full Color 7"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi.  No ads, just a bright white screen that comes in handy ev",1
"This app does exactly as descirbed! The app is bright, easy to use, and great for those trips in the dark or small spaces where you can't get a regular flashlight into.",1
This application does what it is supposed to do.Max out the capabilities of the device of illuminating a room. I can't complain even though the kindle fire d does not have a led light the white background and the high brightness level help to illuminate ,1
"I could not get it to work at all. So frustrating! After several tries, I had to remove the download.",0
"I have tried to load this application and it just won't do it.  I works on my wife's Kindle and gives off good light, but not on mine.",0
Great App! I put this application on my Kindle Fire. No problems and it is brighter than I expected it to be.,1
Was working last week and the sunset while I was up on a mountain and my flashlight was down in the truck. It gave me enough light to walk down the mountain and get to my truck in a pitch black desert night. Thanks!,1

"The idea behind a flashlight application is simply to turn your device's screen bright white, thus rendering a flashlight. This app does only that! Other flashlight apps acess your contacts, gps, and other thongs which are unnecessary. You'd think that f",1
"This works very well. After a recent storm produced a power outage, this app was very useful. You can use it to get around at night without waking anyone. Extremely bright.",1
This app works great! Very bright and useful. It can light up a room using the Kindle Fire's screen if you have one. I recommend you getting this app when you are trying to open the backdoor at night:),1
FlashLight gets 5 Stars from. Many nights sitting outside and playing my Kindle Fire. Its late out no lights on.Shut down my kindle and put my light on and no problems getting around in the dark.Very handy have around.,1
"Simply put, this app makes my Kindle Fire screen turn bright white, which is a pretty effective light. To maximize the light, just turn up your screen brightness with the star shaped icon for settings in the upper right corner of the Kindle screen. Works",1
"I don't use this app often but it is nice to have available. It is very bright. You can also get fancy and have a banner scroll across, however it is not very useful for that purpose.",1
"All I want in a flashlight is for it to make my screen white. That's all this app does. It doesn't require unnecessary permissions, use ads, or do anything else.",1
This app on kindle fire and it is pretty cool. Super bright white light with no extrasplus you can't beat the price of FREE. I really like it.,1
"This is my favorite flashlight app on my first generation Kindle Fire--I tried several before settling on this one--and I would give it 5 stars for the 1st gen KF. I like that it's basic, small, no ads, and has no intrusive permissions. It does exactly w",0

"This didn't work for me. I have a kindle fire and when I opened this app up it just said that the flashlight was stopped. I tried it again and again but it just made my system lag. So I don't know how it will work for you, but for me it was just a waste ",0

I use this on my computer and on my Kindle Fire and on my Blackberry and I love this app.  You can add anything to a list and create items that aren't part of any list it is an all around awesome app.,1
Makes a great list love it,1
I love this product. I used iin the grocery store and was able to mark off items as I went along. It heallped me from duplicating items. It was awesome. I highly recommend this product.,1
I found this did not have what I was looking for.  It might be alright for someone who likes to shop all over town.,0
"I was looking for something to input my pantry on hand items, make my shopping list, and mark the list for coupons.  I guess I was looking for too much, or haven't found the right thing.  I will just keep looking.",0
Don't know whats so complicated about this app but I cant get it to work. Very frustrating when trying to make lists.,0
This wasn't what I expected it to be at all.  I don't know what I was thinking it would be butI ended up deleting it from my kindle.  I can do better with my local grocery store ads.,0
"I was so excited when I discovered this app was available for the Kindle Fire!!  What a disappointment after I downloaded it, installed it and started using it!! It does NOT even compare to the version I have on my 1st generation iPod Touch which I loved",0

I have been using this product since it was first  released! Love it. I have recommended it to my family and friends.,1

Kindle Fire: does not play any videos (gives an error) or force closes.  I have not seen one video play.,0
I tried itout cause my daughter LOVES Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. The longest so called episode is alittle over a minute.... stupid app not worth downloading. Good thing it was free,0
Whenever I click on a show it just goes to YouTube. It's like if I wanted to watch this on YouTube I would just type it in the url,0
love this app i dont know why people rate it so low i love it but the one thing its missing is a quick go back button,1
IT HAS ALL MY FAVORITE CARTOONS (EVEN FREAKIN KIRBY RIGHT BACK ATCH YA) I CQNT BELIVE THAT IT HAS THIS MANY CARTOONS ITS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
The app didn't run correctly on the Kindle Fire HD. It would take me to a particular category I choose but the videos would not play or if it does it's just black screen.,0
i hate this app they dont have sponge bob showes on here.....that sucks DONT GET ITT!!!! I WILL ALWAYS LOVE SPONGEBOB! LONG LIVE BIKINI BOTTOM! THE STARS DONT GO LOW ENOUGH,0
this is great I love it .it has all my favorite shows from when I was a kid its great for my kindle fire.,1
Your child's own little Tv and remote in which they can watch lots of Tv shows from old to new.  I truly recommend it and just like the product review stated it can be used anywhere!,1
The library is huge. They put alot of effort into getting hundreds of the best cartoons from 90 & 2000s. Its not just for kids either theres plenty of shows for adults too. From clasics like Scooby Doo to new shows like Kim Possible. Once again try this ,1

It only gives you a few choices. It seems like the same ones all the time. It stinks free or not.,0
Great app if you have small kids. It compiles all the cartoons from youtube into one browseable app. There are a lot of old cartoons that you can easily watch and reminisce about the old days.,1

Works flawlessly. Syncs your starbucks card with in seconds of entering data. Has a barcode so that you can let starbucks scan it to pay for your coffee without using your card. I would recommend this if your a gold card holder.,1

"When you get Gin you can't go out, you have to do some knock thing and dead somethings are counted.  I took it off my device almost as fast as I put it on.",0
This graphics are clear and the game controls are easy to master. I play for hours. I just love this game and you will too. The price is also right...,1
If I could reach through and strangle those people I would! I get so tired of losing my status! Let the player win some will ya?!?!!,0
"I like this game because it moves the cards for me.  Puts them in order as they are dealt and when I make runs are groups, it puts them together.  Unfortunately, I don't win often.  My opponents are really tough and quick.",1
I play this game all the time.  I wish I had it on my computer so I could play more,1
Gin rummy is probably one of my most favorite card games and this free game really delivers. It is a great game and hard to put down. There are 5 different levels that you can play on from beginner to expert.,1
"I love that as you get better, you have more difficult players to face. Tournament mode is fun too as you face players of increasing difficulty and different styles. I'm soon gonna wish for more  &quot;players&quot; to face.",1
This is a fun little app for my phone! I play it when I am waiting around!!!!! I would recommend it to a friend! My husband plays this more than I do!,1
Great game.  Quickly became a favorite!  Would definitely recommend to all who enjoy card games.  Works great on Droid X.,1
"I have had lots of fun with this product, the implementation is really good and generally bug free.The UI is nice, getting Gin Rummy to fit in a small UI is never easy. I have a 3.7"" screen and big fingers but I am able to pick out what cards without pro",1
"I downloaded this game many moons ago. After it I download apps daily but have been going back to good old gin rummy almost daily. It is just a very quick and enjoyable game that doesn't get monotonous.This game, with the variety of AI players, subtle so",1
With today's update it gets five stars from me. I play this every day cuz I can start and stop and it resumes where I left it. My only issue was the size of the cards. I got a stylet to play with so I wouldn't accidentally toss the wrong card. With the n,1
This game is too easy to make unintensional moves.  The cards are difficult to arrange and discard.  Don't waste your time.,0
I am hooked...... I play this the most on my kindle fire. I love it. The best version I have seen..,1
"it is a very good game. don't see how people are saying it is too hard, maybe they don't know how to play gin. it is fun and very easy to use. I love gin rummy and this is really everything you could ask for in a gin rummy game",1
Excellent game with different opponents and levels of skill. I enjoy changing opponents every 5 games to get a different perspective from another style of play by an opponent. Teaches good rummy skills.,1
"By far the best gin rummy game I have ever played. good opponents, nice graphics,and easy to play. I spend WAY too much time playing.",1
I'm addicted to this game.  The graphics and sounds are great and I like competing with the computer which is winning most of the games ....so far.  I look forward to zooming ahead in games.  Try it.,1
"any free app could do without ads, but the placement of these ads werent so bad. i was able to learn the bare bones of the game just by reading the rules here and playing several practice rounds. luckily the game keeps track of the score for me.",1
I love card games.  I love this app as a time waster while waiting in the movie theater etc..,1
I play Gin Rummy every day.  I enjoy playing this game. I am glad it is free.  Every one that plays the real card gin rummy should try this game.  Enjoy.,1
This game has good graphics and was easy to understand how to actually play. I would recommend it for anyone wanting to play Gin.,1
the games controls r probably for know it alls. it gave me a headache. the controls r deffinetly horrible. I love rummy but not this,0

I waited on writing this review because I wanted to see if the things other people wrote in their reviews were true and I just hadn't noticed.1. The claims of soft porn ads....Completely False (unless you consider Disney soft porn).2.Cards being dealt mo,1
I love this game and I spend hours playing it. It's addicting and I highly recommend it. I need three more words,1
"I like this game alot, it's just like playing with a group of friends. It is a fast moving game & doesn't get boring.",1
There are several other gin games I like better.  Found this one a little bit tedious to manipulate.Requiring each review to meet a word minimum is dumb.,0
I love that you get to choose your opponent. I am just competitive enough to feel pride on those occasions when I beat them.  Great graphics. No glitches. Great game!,1
"I enjoy playing this game quite often. I've now learned to play Gin, in addition to Rummy. Lot's of fun! Thanks!",1
"This is an awesome card game! It takes a few hands to get used to, but well worth it! I enjoy being beaten by the computer competitor...not for long as I get better every hand!",1
If you aren&apos;t doing as well as you think you should you probably aren&apos;t playing on the right level. I do the best playing against Finn much to my surprise but I was always a very good rummy player as s kid. \n,1
"This app is great for anyone that likes to play Gin Rummy.  It is a lot of fun, especially if you can beat your opponent. There are several opponents to choose from to give you a challenge. I like to play this on rainy days and when I am being lazy. This",1
"I really like this game. Each character has different levels of strength, so the game stays challenging. I play this app on my Kindle Fire and have no problems with it or the loading. Good buy and always fun.",1
"This game sucks. It was fun until I noticed it was dealing cards previously discarded in the same game, drawing out of turn, and awarding itself more points when winning.  For winning the game (not the hand)  the game gave itself 5-10 points versus the m",0
I've played recreational gin for decades and this is very like real games. Don't see what the complaints are about. I'd pay for this app. Can't tear myself away.,1
"I installed this in hopes of a good game and found myself uninstalling it in just a few minutes. They place the ads at the bottom of the screen where you will accidentally hit them while trying to get to the menus, and then most of the ads are nothing sh",0
"People need to stop being sore losers. When people write programs like this, they use a random command to generate the cards. Sometimes I win one, then lose one or win a few in a row or lose a few in a row. It's RANDOM. It's all about developing at strat",1
they give u to many cards from how I normally play with 5 cards each person so I think this game doesn't even play gin right. DO NOT BUY,0
honestly kids play these card games too! they definifltely don't need to see ads like this! what were the devs thinking?! change this please,0
I got this game really didn't think I would play it that much I play it almost every night or when things are slow at work on my break.,1
This is such a fun game!  I like that there are different opponents to play against. I can't believe this is a free game. Love it!,1
I enjoy playing this game live so it is great to play it on my kindle fire. Great great. @,1
i love this app. i do not have trouble with it freezing. i rarely win but i have a lot of options. i like this from Amazon rather than the market. as I have had a lot of phones it is easy to re download.,1
My favorite game that I have downloaded so far. I play this game every day. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge.,1
I like that I can stop playing any time and pick up right where you  leave off.  Good graphic and easy to play.  This is great game and allows you play for ashort time or tealy get into.  I have never had an issue with the game closing or freezing.  Htc ,1
"First off, don't know what all the negative reviewers are whining about; the game doesn't cheat, it just gets progressively harder, just as it should! A gin rummy pro will not play a hand for 12 minutes until someone can knock with no dead wood, it's abo",1
"Beautiful graphics, and it plays wellGin is one of my favorite games and now I can play it as often as I want",1
Fun,1
"Beautifully designed, plays fast, AI is fun to play against. One of my favorite card games. Running on an HTC EVO 3D.",1
"I chose this rating because I think it's the best gin rummy game available, and I highly recommend it to those who like to play gin rummy!",1
"Okay,I really love this game. I play at least 2-3 rounds everynight when I get home for work. Such a fun game..",1
"When you need to waste some time, this is a good game to waste it with. I play this often.",1
Easy and fun to play.  Great to have when waiting in doctor office.  Love having a card game with out having to worry about the cards,1
Anybody who loves Gin Rummy will love this game as well. Same rules and very addictive. I recommend this game to all card lovers!,1
"Love playing gin and this is the perfect app for me.  Graphs good and never shuts down, or not yet.",1
THIS IS A great app and it was free. its the game of gin with 3 other players from the computer it also works on my pandigital )( see my review for that as well ) .Try some more apps from the amazon app store.,1
Got this game on a whim. Ended up playing it all the time. Definately worth more than the price! Only down side is the inability to have &quot;house&quot; rules but that hasn't stopped me from playing!,1
"This is a fun game.  I usually play right before bed, so I know I have deleted my day.  Good one!  It's fun to change opponents, and they win as much as I do!  I recommend this game for brain balance and calming down.",1
"Lots of fun to play,  still a challenge to beat your other player.game goes fast if you don't have a lot of time.",1
"I didn't like this app, I didn't follow it, I was user friendly at all, not fun, not stimulating, boring.",0
I love play rummy because it makes you thinks a lot and a card game and you can play it with yours friends.,1
I liked this app. I play it when im bored at work when i cant read. I used to play as a kid so this was fun to have on my kindle,1
"Great game, I waste, I mean spend too much time playing this app.  Very well done, neat graphics, but not over the top. This was the 2nd Gin game I tried and the 4 or 5 afterwards were deleted so fast, they couldn't come close to this.",1
"I had not played in many, many years and was happy to find this app. It is well made with quality graphics. many options and modes of play. I would rather have the payed version tho due to the fact that in play it it&apos;s way to easy to accidently hit ",1
"#1: Ignore all the bad reviews BECAUSE I think they probably haven't played it long enough to REALLY  figure this game out. One person said it throws all face cards: Yes it throws a lot of face cards, but that is really an advantage because you can quick",1
Great game and graphics.  You have several levels of skill and you can pick your own level.  You won't be disappointed.,1
I have never played the card game before playing this one. What makes it interesting is that you can play 5 different players.,1
Well worth it.  My favorite card game by far.  I haven't played this since I was little.  I was glad to see it on here.  THANKS!!!!,1
"I lost my standard gmail bookmark to a virus, so that this is a very fast way to replace it.",1
I tried suing the app a few times and then I deleted this app - it was what I expected it to be,0

"this application is simple and helps me clean my e mails in order when i am away from home,  for me works just fine i would recommend it.",1
Could not use this app. Not compatible with kindle.  Wasted time downloading and uninstalling immediately afterwards.  It probably is great if you own a Sony eriksson device.,0
This app comes in handy at anytime of the day! I think that having this app is a very good thing!,1
"I got this app for my daughter's kindle.  We love furbabies and to have one on the other side cleaning our screen gives us a boost.  I would love a doxie on the other side, but any furbaby will do!",1

"My dog is adorable and he is a mix of a Boston terrier and a beagle, (hence the name Boggle). I got this app thinking the  black dog was Labrador. Plus the app looked insanely adorable, like the &quot;Dog Screen Cleaner&quot; app (with the pug). But it w",1

Not at all like the android game on my phone. Was very dissapointed in it. Would not recommend to my friends.,0

The Maxthon browser is way faster and has better features than the Kindle Fire browser. I really like my Kindle Fire and this makes it better. I got the add-on that allows you to import your bookmarts from the Kindle browser of which I recommend for ever,1

I have limited experience (this is the only translation app I have used) but my most important criteria for me is how user friendly it is. And this app scores a solid five. It is intuitive and easy to use.,1

"Great for free app. NEEDS a clear button that does not require you close the keyboard and open the menu. I buy apps that I like, but even tho the app offers an upgrade, it is not accessible.  YES, the app makes errors in translation, but my spanish speak",1

its cool if you havent played other jewel apps but if you have you would know that this one has plain jewels plain colors bad graphics and not many special jewels or special effects in the game  i woild recomend jewel star its fun free colorfull exciting,0
This game is the closest thing to Bejeweled without the name! Great graphics and sounds. This beats the pants off off the other game with the same name! The other one sucks compared to this one. Just being brutally honest!,1

Any 3 match game is fun and jewels has them all. Addicting and exciting as it gets when playing these games. Keep up the good work on presenting these types of games.,1
I use this a lot when I am crocheting. It helps me keep track of what row I am on. Great! But I have to keep my phone plugged in because the screen stays on. Small price to pay for such a great app.,1
I don't like the fact that the phone will stay on so I don't have to unlock it to count the rows. I also don't like how it functions.,0
"This app is soo much easier than keeping tally marks on paper.  No worry of dropping your needle / hook to hunt and grab a pen, draw a tally mark, pick up your dropped needle /hook then resume your work.  Just tap the screen and resume.  Saves soo much t",1

This definitely goes to favorites on my Kindle Fire.I have fast access to Wikipedia instantaneously.Just compare to the speed on the regular website.,1
Disappointed in the feature articles showing up on the home screen.  Not easy to look up items.  Prefer to get the info from a google seach with brings up Wikipedia and others sources.,0
I like how when you load it it randomly pulls up an article for the day. It's pretty much as easy as navigating the real site and works great on the Fire.,1
"This is absolutely stunning. I downloaded it for my 5 year old (who loves it) and I play with it as much as she does. The designs are endless and colors are amazing, plus you can save your work on your phone or tablet.",1
"Not in a negative way, mind you - sometimes you need to disconnect from reality, and this app allows me to do just that.Easy to use, and some of the designs you can make with it are really cool.",1
"This is by far the BEST drawing app I have seen!  I took me a bit to get the hang of it, but once I did...  Wow!  This is my new favorite app!!!",1
This app is awesome! I downloaded it for my 5 year old son.  It's the same concept as the old magna doodles but in a more modern format.  Gone are the need for crayons and paper.  The best thing about this app is that it records your drawings and plays t,1
"Everyone should read this version - it is a loving, and a lovely read - well worth loading..., it is a permanent resident on my tablet",1
THE MESSAGE book is just that. I thought it was another version of the bible but this could not be further from the truth. When it is compared with a true translation (and this is a paraphrased effort) it holds only a mild resemblance to the bible.,0
"I love The Message version of the Bible. It's so easy to read and understand. This app keeps with the simplicity. It's easy to navigate and find just the books, chapters or verses you are looking for. In a word, perfect!",1
"The Message Bible is easy to understand. It is easy to read and makes comprehending easier. I like the KJV in general;  but just for reading and getting a better understanding, The Message Bible gets five stars.",1

"This is not a study Bible, but I love the modern vernacular used in the translation!  Great for easy reading.",1
this is very easy to follow and understand. makes the word easy. I suggest for any new reader of the bible,1
This app is one of my all time favorotes. It gives me the ability to get a more &quot;current&quot; look at the scriptures.  A better understanding of how God's words relate to me today!,1
Pretty easy to use &amp; doesn't need Internet connection. I love the parallel display &amp; making notes in the nation. Great choice.,1
"I love this Tecarta Bible App. I switch easily between several versions as I read, quickly able to compare the way different translations or paraphrases as I process spiritual truth. The Message in particular presents vocabulary and phrases different eno",1
I have wanted the message bible and to get it in the app was really awesome.  The price was right too.,1

"this game is fun. And for you guys who don't know how to move the people you click them,and to move sally you tap on the people.And I got a discount because on my I pod touch the full version is $2.99 ,but on my kindle fire the full version was0.99 cents",1
"It is nothing like the pc, and it is very hard to control. Waste of money. And the app is small on the screen.",0

"I played this game once and I already know it stinks.  DO NOT get this game . it is waste of money. you cant even get the people to move, so they are geting madder, when you, are pounding you fingers through your kindel fire. do not get",0
This is a good time killer. I like the upgrades and the challenge of getting all perfect levels. I also like that you have to learn the best times to use the different bonuses.,1
I love this game it is so much fun to play can barley pit it down I finished it in 3 days so much fun,1
This app does anything but waste your time. It's also a waste of money and does not work very well.,0
I've played this game on my desktop &amp; enjoyed it as well as sally's salon. But this app freezes my kindle to the point it shuts off &amp; may take a lil while to come back on! I'm so disappointed because sally's salon works fine on here.....all I can,0
My friend recommended this game and I love it. Fun interaction game Wish there were more games like this one.,1
Sally's Spa is a good game for girls are women to play this game is a pretty good game to play I think you will enjoy it when you start playing it.....;-),1
"Great time management game! Fun, challenging, & Addicting! Graphics are Good & plays perfect on K.F.Cant wait for the Next Sallys,keep it goin RealNetworks,time for another!!",1
"I don't like that it is so small, even on the kindle. It is only half of the screen. It should be full screen like Sally 's Salon. I wish I had known it was so small before I paid for it.",0
I wish I didnt have to give this app a bad review because its a nice looking app but it doesn't work very good.,0
"This app says its free but once you click on what card you want to make, it takes you to an app purchase where you have to buy it.:(",0
This app didn't have any greeting cards that was of any interest to me so I deleted this app as soon as I downloaded it.,0

This NIV Bible App is a blessing in my sermon preparations. It is easy to navigate through the Bible and the NIV is a very good translation to use. I have purchased many different Bible Version Apps from this same company and use them often. I recommend ,1
"The Bible is organized well and easy to find additional information as needed!  The other  publishers that are available are much more expensive and not worth the additional cost.  In general, I'm happy with this purchase.",1
I currently have a hardback NIV as well as Wesley Study  NKJV and also a NLT.Having the NIV as an APP on the Kindle HD puts it at our fingertips.  We pick it up often and read it.,1
Love this app. Especially for Bible studies and is amazing how easyit is to find passages of scripture and of course for making notes.,1
"I love that it doesn't require internet, and I can switch between NIV and KJV. It will hilight, bookmark, you can change the names of your bookmarks or just leave them as Book and Chapter, overall just a really great Bible! Definitely worth the money.",1
I purchased this app also the King James version because it was more convenient than carrying two bibles to church. I prefer King James but my pastor preaches from NIV. I love that you don't need Wi-Fi to use.,1
I use this app all the time you can download the bibles on your Kindle to use without internet connections.  Lester,1
"I love the King James Bible, and its cross references, however, when studying my Bible and I need it simplified for understanding, I can always read it in the NIV Bible.",1

I like the ease of using this Bible.  I depend on the text to speech aspect a lot.  Way better than it used to be.  I highly recommend this.,1
The more I use this app the better I like it. The better I like  this app the more I use it. Discover the opportunities to creatively read &amp; study the Bible.,1
I chose this Bible app because of the reviews which said it was the easiest for clicking into a specific verse.  They were right.  I am very pleased.,1
I have this on my old tablet but will be putting on my new one.I like having my Bible near me and I usually take the tablet if I'm sitting waiting at the Dr office. Thats often too!!,1

This is a great Bible that I can take with me when I don't have online service.  It's a bit hard to take notes on.,1
Very easy to use.  Taking notes is much easier in this bible app than others I've tried. WOULD recommend this app.,1

Like this app alot.  It has many different chaplets to choose from.  It has made my prayer life better when I can choose different prayers daily.,1
It is a complete masterpiece designed by a higher power that is so cool it is breathtaking enough to mal some forward contemplations,1
has all the chaplets that I use and then some all in one place! Makes it easy to find and pray so many devotions to Our Lady.,1

This is a great starter application for anyone who has language difficulties.  My son has autism. I hope to teach him to use this program to help him have another way to communicate. The basic version is free!,1
This lite version is a waist of time. It is very hard to make a sentence. I am afraid to buy the full version because it may not be much better. It is clumsy and not laid out very well. Don't wait your time.,0
I still have not been able to figure out how to use it.  Not at all user friendly.  Poor insturctions.,0

It uses googles push to send and receive messages. This means that even if you lose connection you still get them as soon as you get your connection back. Awesome.,1

"I've uploaded a few calendar apps, this is the only keeper. It's basic and I- do not need to sync.  Only one day and I'm already happy.And it was free today so people should stop whining when it cost them nothing!!!!",1
This app doesn't work. There is no way to type and add notes for a particular day. At least it's free.,0
I love this app. I am in college and this helps me keep track what's due and what classes I have that day.,1
I actually love this app! Don't waste your money on other apps when this one is perfectly fine you can check when everything is and even go ahead and back many many many years,1
The app worked for a few weeks on my Kindle Fire but now while it's on the loading screen it just crashes (or as Kindle likes to put it just stops). It's kind of upsetting since it works on on my Galaxy 2 but not on my Fire.,0

This app works fine on my Samsung Intercept (Virgin Mobile) which is kind of a low end phone. Its a pretty large distribution at 15MB but it mostly moves to SD  leaving just 900KB of internal memory.,1
I'm giving this app 5 stars to offset the idiots only giving it 1 star! I would give it 4 stars. It's a fun time waster with decent graphics and very good play. Why do people come to amazon if they don't wanna sign up for an account?  I have over 30 apps,1
well its good to know there's only a few people who rate this game with one star all these days I feel angry because the low reviews. come on people. It's free,1

"This looks like a really good app, but to only allow me to keep track of 1 automobile to me is really not worth it...I would like to keep track of at least 2 automobiles...Just my opinion",0
"This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! I tried the few others that are free. This is the only one to give me a way to track maintenance on my car, schedule intervals, reminders, etc etc. I am thoroughly impressed with this app.",1
This little program really helps keep records in order.  I was amazed at the many areas it covers.  It give small graphs for us freaks who like to keep complete records of our vehicles.,1
"yes, the description lies less than the title, but both mislead. the only reviewers giving high stars are the few developers and their friends. everyone else is giving them a one star.",0
This app falsely advertises itself as a &quot;coin scanner &quot;. It does NOT scan coins at all! Very disappointed and immediately uninstalling from my phone.,0
Perhaps a pre-requisite for owning a smart phone should be being literate. This is a great app that does exactly what it says it will do. It even demonstrates what it does in a photo. If you thought you could scan any given penny and trace that singular ,1

"I can see this as being a handy app to have. Camping or just ""in the dark""? This could be your salvation. Has it's own alarm setup system, change colors and 24-hr clock along with numerous other options. Simple, but nice app to have.",1
The night clock is a great addition to my Kindle Fire. It allows me to have a travel clock and a clock I can use for small meetings so all can see the time. You know how we all hate meetings that run past the allocated time.  Very cool.,1

I wanted a full screen clock that I could use on my kindle fire and this app fit the bill.,1
I use this app when I'm traveling because Hotels never seems to have a nightstand clock that has a working backlight.  This app does the trick.  It has a day and night mode to the brightness so that at night you won't be annoyed by the backlight.,1
"It's a big, bright, bold and easy to read clock that I can see from across the room even without my glasses.",1
"this is just what I was looking.for.  simple and to the point night clock. options to change colors and landscape mode. looking for a night clock, look no further.",1
I needed a clock I can see in the dark without disturbing my sleep and this is the perfect solution for any room lacking a clock.,1
I use this clock every night on the dim mode.  The dim mode is the best part of the clock.  I also love that you can change the font on the clock.,1
I already had a Kindle that wasn't really doing much sitting there on the shelf and I needed a clock but I didn't want to buy one and this app came through and really delivered a great clock app for my Kindle. Now if I could just get rid of that little o,1

The Night Clock helped wake up in the morning even in Spring.It would go off right at the time I set it at.The best part is it goes off after the time I used it.,1

One of the hardest things I had to do when I left NEOhio was to leave WKSU behind. I joined three other stations in places where I lived and they were good.  None came close to WKSU.  And there was nothing like Jim Blum.  Then came Folk Alley.com.  Heave,1
"This station is a delight to which to listen.  NPR at its best, along with wonderful classical music.  The combination of news and music is difficult to find on the airwaves today.",1

i like this app. its fun and can be accomplished by all ages! its great! i deff reccommend this app!,1
I love this game for keeping my 5 and 7 year old entertained. We also like to play it together. It could use a few more levels because hard isn't all that hard but overall. it is a great game. Love the colorful characters,1

This app is really cute. My granddaughter is three and loves playing.  The creatures wiggle when she gets them all and she just giggles.  And yes..grandma likes playing too!,1
This one will keep the little ones busy tote quite a while (especially if you play too) .  Creatures are cute and the game helps build attention span.,1

I have bought folder organizer few months back.. so comparing with it.. GUI is comparatively good.. but  this app is slow to open folder.. Also one HUGE function missing is to keep folder open after you access some app from it.. e.g. if I have stored new,0
I really liked this app. I've downloaded others prior and found them to be not as user friendly. this was definitely worth the download!,1

I prefer this over Smart Shortcuts actually. The folders are much cleaner looking and there's several options as to how the shortcuts show up. Only problem I can see is that there isn't enough icons.,1
"while there is a bit of a learning curve to this, it is a must have. Unlike the stock folders created by Droid, if you use this, all icons stay in place if the phone is restarted. totally worth the money. Love it!",1
Great app. Simplistic and easy to use. You can have personalized icons for the folder. Different ways for the look when you open the folder. I love this.,1
I have been looking for a good application organizer and this is it.  I tried 3 others but they were not intuitive enough.  this includes customizations that the others don't.  I especially love being able to customize the actual icon on your screen.  gr,1

"Great for grouping , news version ads more folder styles, I already had people at the office drooling over it..only thing I don't like its the message on start up about illegal downloads every single time.",1
Your android system already provides the same ability of creating application shortcut folders. This application is completely unneeded. It's a really annoying trend I've seen in Android app stores not just in amazon.,0
the icons are to generic for me. sticking with the stock folders app for now. I may try some of the other apps mentioned by other reviewers.,0

I played this on the PC and thoroughly enjoyed it. So when I saw it on the andoird I was excited.....but it force closes on the Droid X2 when first opened. =(,0
This is a very fun game. just started playing it and really enjoy it. controls are excellent and easy to use with accurate and precise character movement.  Shift concept makes game even more challenging and interesting! Great app!!,1

Interesting game. The makers really thought outside the box in creating this one. I just wish it was bit easier on the eyes with higher resolution.,1
Sloppy coding. Will not run on NI Adam tablet. Force close every time after opening screen. Tried several times after rebooting. No dice.,0

A nice game to kill some time. it works perfectly and smoothly. Why some rate one star makes no sense. This is a simple game but even the simplest things are too complicated for some.,1
Awesome!  Just an force closure bananza!  My little crappie phone just can't handle this wonderful force closing game. Wish more games would FC like this one!  Definitely a 5 star FCer.,1
The controls for this game seem off on the eve. It's very hard just to navigate your character on the screen I would pass this on even for free,0
The shift concept is a clever idea and adds interest and challenge in visualizing a plan to navigate each puzzle.,1
Fun game. Works fine on a droid x - perhaps the whiners and low raters should get some hardware/software that is post 2009. I did notice most low reviews were not rating the actual game but technical issues instead.Could use more levels though.,1
"I thought the shift concept was creative, however; the action for the though screen controls seems to have the same sensitivity issue that most of these games do. Maybe that's supposed to be part of the challenge...IDK.  Anyway, worth it as the free app ",1

"Same problem others are having with LG Optimus, no matter the letter designation. Tried to install, hard reboots phone. So disapointed! Please fix!!",0
this is a AWESOME app. its really fun and entertaining. its also very time consuming. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!HE HEHEHEHEHEHEHE hehehehehehe,1
"This is a really fun game. It does freeze up once in a while, but the price is right. It has adds but they keep them out of the way.If they iron out the bugs this could be up there with angry birds. Good job.",1

"To begin with, probably 99% of the low ratings are due to non-compatibility. I think there should be another way to mark phones not compatible other than giving it a 1 star rating. That just does not properly show how good an app/game actually is. Now on",1
I was really looking forward to trying out this application however when I tried to install it it just restarted my phone every time that&apos;s really too bad lg optimus v,0
"I downloaded this on our Vegan-tab G-Tab and my 4 (almost 5) year old loves it. He&apos;s been playing it over and over again. Plus, it&apos;s free.",1
best game. better than ANGRY BIRDS. ANGRY BIRDS!!!! I love that people created the game listen to me no one else!!,1
"Bright graphics, quick loading, and actually requires some intelligence to play the higher levels. We need lots more like this one...",1
"This app makes my phone crash every time I try to install it. It looks like a game I&apos;d like, so I&apos;m pretty disappointed.",0
Just like a few others the game reboots my phone during install.  It&apos;s too bad because this looks like the best rabbit space sim I would&apos;ve ever played.,1
"Entertaining little game. Very reminiscent of Super Mario Galaxy, which is a good thing. Fun, somewhat challenging. Has run on my Htc Thunderbolt with no problems. Highly recommended.",1
runs smooth on my samsung captivate. no freezing or rebooting like others are complaining about. this is a fun game with nice smooth graphics.,1
every time I tried to install my phone would shut down. It never did install. I don't get it. Not good,0
this game is awesome! I&apos;ve played through a lot of the levels. they get pretty challenging. haven&apos;t had any crashing or downloading problems on my Droid or Thunderbolt.,1
I HAVE HAD DOCTORS AND ALL KIND OF EDUCATED PEOPLE TRY THEIR LUCK ON THE SAMPLE TEST AND THIS SEEMS HARD FOR NEARLY EVERYONE. IT DOES MAKE ONE STOP AND THINK TO REASON OUT IF YOU CAN THE ANSWER. I LIKE THAT IT DOES GIVE THE REASON AND EXPLAINS THE ANSWER,1
This game wouldn't download.  O believe I tried twice and gave up.  I would like to try again on the future to at least Der what it was like,0
"Great Game, can be very changelling, but just what I wanted.  If you love a challenge, this is the game for you.",1
"There are so many ways to improve your mind with this device. Topics are: analogy, blood relationships, classification, coding/decoding, direction sense, logical reasoning, mathematical operations, number/ranking/sequence, series, statements/conclusions/",1
You better be prepared when you play this &#34;game&#34;.  It is EXTREMELY challenging and very intense.  Intriguing questions in every area of knowledge.  You have to exercise ALL of your brain power to figure some of the questions!!  A real mental work,1
This is a fantastic app to retrain ur brain....occasionally hangs up but I'm yet to find an app that doesn't...nothing to get annoyed about. Really great exercises for the brain!,1
Damn thing went to my cloud when I was reviewing it and then just started d/l. Took 107 of my coins. I deleted it !! Did not want it to begin with. Beware of this with this app.,0
So much to this app. So many questions and sections. It just keeps going and going. Love the challange of it!,1
Too complicated for me. Was hoping to find something more relaxing and easier to do. Will have to try more of crosswords type. Will keep looking.,0
thought that it was for the kindledidnt payattentionfirst app I got when I first bought the kindlesure its a good game just not for the kindle,0

Fantastic test.  Always wanted to know my IQ.  I was surprised as to how high it was. You will like it.,1

"First off there is no tutorial. There are also balance problems with the enemies. Finally, when I exit the game it doesn't save my progress, so I have to start over.This game was not ready for release.",0

I want this game but you cant buy on the kindle fire.. it sorta sad. if they made this for the fire id love it! thanks,1
only wish is that it would let you set sequences of colors for the marbles given as the ammo. Some orders might be impossible though but downloading a sequence to help make it easier could be a big help. The sequences for levels could be rated too as eas,1

If you need an app to tell you how to pay off debt I think you have bigger problems.  An app won't stop you from buying Starbucks or tell you it's only $2.00 more for quality gasoline.  It's also not going to yell at you when you buy snacks for a road tr,1

"This is one of those apps that does what it says it will do. As long as you have a source for calibrating it it will give good readings. It's also handy for checking the angle on, let's say, a table saw. You zero it to your table then find out what angle",1
"This is a very cool app. It is a level that is very accurate, has 45 degrees, Vertical, and horizontal levels. Reads out in degrees out of level. Has a calibration adjustment as well. very handy.",1
"Plain and simple - this turns your tablet into a bubble level.  I know there are 3 or 4 levels in our house and garage, but finding one when I need it is time consuming.  I always know where my tablet is so I will be using this one quite often.  PS - you",1
"This works great, BUT... you have to take any case off you phone or it won't be accurate.  I use an Otterbox Defender and taking it off at a job site is not an option.  But I wasn't really expecting it would replace my old-fashioned bubble level.This has",1
I downloaded it on my iPad and then it said I need adobe air so I downloaded that and it still would not work,0
Good for use on the fly when you don't have access to your tools. Appears to be reasonably accurate in most situations.,1
This is outstanding.  Would love it if they produced one of these for the physical world!  I would love it if they added a virtual plumb line and table top bubble level.,1
This is cool. I'm hoping to get how to work it properly. This can be really helpful for stuff around the house.,1
Who would have guessed that this app would be so sensative?  It even measures down to tenths of a degreee!Fun application!,1
The level can be set to make a tome so you can HEAR when something is level if you can't see the display.,1
"This is so simple. I was always losing my little level. Now it's on my phone and it works just fine, at least for making sure pictures are straight.",1
"works great on my droid 2.2 - remember you need adobe air. nice work! I have not had a chance to use it for a project, just tested it out. but I never know where my levels are and phones always there.",1
i tried a couple apps for bubble levels. They all were the same. This one gives you the addition of an angle .,1
I was using another app for a while; but this one provides three types of leveling at the same time.  I wish it could be magnified; but it still does a good job and is easy to use.,1
This is simply wonderful! what a great addition to have it make a sound when level. perfect for when outside and can barely make out the screen. Thanks Dev!,1
"This is a great use of the tablet's gyroscope.  It's a level and works great at being just that....whether you want something leveled horizontally or vertically, it works like a charm.  No more turning the level to level out the table...just set the tabl",1

"Remember those tile games we played as kids? There was one open space and the object was to figure out how to slide the tiles around and finally complete a pattern?Well, this is kinda like that, but not. Lol...how is that for vague?It's a simple strategy",1
When I first played this I was hooked. I love puzzle games. I haven't played in the pass few days though. Just had to take a break and try other games. I assure you that I will return to play this app.,1
"If you like puzzles that are mind-boggling, then this is for you!  I love this game.  It gets very frustrating, but I love the challenge.  I play the relaxed mode so I can take my time and think about what the next move will be.  It's very addictive, and",1
I am 8 and this app is NASTY I've only had it for 2 days and zip through it just to get some ideas and even on normal only mode there is some ADULT CONTENT. If children play this I'd say they are very IDIOTIC children. I highly recommend the mangobird on,0
Remember playing it when I was young so got this for my girls.  They love it and have a lot of fun.,1
"The developer did not include a check to see if the question had recently been asked, so it tends to dare people to do the same things over and over. Variation would be an improvement.",0
I was playing this and it kept telling me to&quot; wrap yourself up like a party present&quot; and it was annoying,0
I got this and immediately deleted it because it asked me if I wanted to play adult dares.... ummmmm I don't think so. I'm not gonna have anything with adult content I'm 14!! Shouldn't have adult games for sale in a kids app store!,0
"This is a good app, but it left me wanting more. It is one the better truth or dare apps, though. It is NOT at all inappropriate for all the parents and sensible children reading this. It is a great game for sleepovers and parties! There are many ads, so",1
there are ads taking up the whole page almost. images are real grainy and cheap. dares suck. &quot;put peanut butter under one armpit and jelly the other. wipe it off with bread and eat it&quot; don't waste your time,0
Are you serious I am so dissatisfied with this app I mean the whole point of this game is to make you laugh or get really surprised or something happy but seriously this is just stupid it says wrap yourself up in a Christmas present as a dare and for tru,0
this app is just wat i was looking for i had some really good sex all night it was.the best night of my entire life,1
I am only 9 and this game is gross i was checking what some of the dares wereand it said take of your pants and sit on the opposite sex of you for 30 seconds so don't get this app I AM WARNING YOU DONT GET THIS APP.,0
I am 13 and this is the grossest app ever. it told me to strip to no clothes and for thirty seconds anobody in the room can rub or massage e anywhere. I do not approve of this app and I do not recommend it for kids around my age. I would really appreciat,0
everybody hates this app so I do too.  ads suck. now add several more words to tell u I hate. apps with too many ads.,0
OMG this app is terrible. The jokes are terrible with the little jokes there are! If you want my oppinion don't get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ):,0
these are not even jokes like seriously who just thinks they are good they are horrible. ew. i wouldnt dare look at it,0
look you should see how much i hate it there is like thousands of adds and there are nearly any jokes and guess what you wouldn't believe that there is this person said it should be rated five stars and stuff like that i just wish that person would be in,0
Did not work on my kindle fire at ALL!  after entering all of the tedious required info in order to link up my various accounts it would not find places on foursquare or even go back.  This useless app was quickly uninstalled!  don't waste your time!,0
I couldn't resist. I Love this product because it allows me the opportunity to manage all of my social platforms at once and schedule posts when I know that I am not available. If I have an issue with the app I just tweet hootsuite and they respond right,1
"I use it all  the time for our customers for advertising on the web, tweet, etc.recommend it to all.",1
"Loving Hoot on Fire. Don't fancy twitter app, tried tweet caster for weeks, way too slow although liked features. Tried Hoot to speed things up &amp; it really flies on my Fire, &amp; features are excellent.  give it a try!",1
it does what I expect and it is great. I only use it for twitter and its the best twitter app ive used.,1

This app makes it ready and convenient to keep track of all my social networks. I would definately recommend it.,1
"Whether business or personal or both.... this IS the APP.  Great on pc or mac .. seamless on Android and Fire.  Have used Pro for 4 (four)years for self and three (3) clients.  I can see ALL ACCTS INCL Facebooks, LinkedIn, Twitter, ON TEN ACCTS AT ONCE. ",1
I love being able to juggle my personal and business twitter accounts at the same time.  Huge time saver.  Must have.,1
I am very impressed with this free app. The interface is very user friendly. I enjoy using it just as much as the desktop version. There are no annoying ads. I would very much recommend this app.,1
Every time I try log in to twitter it tells me there is an incorrect username and password... but I haven't even been able to add my twitter username or password. Facebook works fine. So frustrating. It seems like a common problem between all KF twitter ,0

HootSuite is my twitter and facebook client of choice. It makes scanning all my twitter lists a quick and easy task. I use it on both my Kindle Fire and Galaxy S3 with no problems at all.,1
I could not get this app to work correctly but it might be my crummy no-name tablet.  I just kept getting stuck in a loop between setting up the account and adding any social media account.  I just uninstalled.  But it may work well for you.,0
I was loving this app until the update three days ago. Now it won't even load my accounts. Litterally nothing at all. Just a blank page. Now I've had to switch back to Tweetcaster and my regular Facebook app. Why do these apps keep having updates that ru,0
"This is definitely one of if not the best app that combines multiple social networking sites. Fortunately it's a free download, however, I would DEFINITELY pay  for this app if I had to! Congrats to the developers, and thanks for such an efficient yet ef",1

This is a good FREE tool to manage my twitter feeds and status on FB and Linked In.  I'll keep it.,1
I just updated the app and it no longer works. Its totally garbage IDK if its hootsuites fault or Amazons but it needs to be fixed ASAP,0
"It won't let me add Facebook after I added Twitter and LinkedIn. It says I need to pay for pro to get a 5th stream--but I'm only trying to add a third! Without Facebook, it's pretty much pointless.",0

"Those complaining about Foursquare not working on their Kindle Fire: Kindle Fire doesn't have the gps set up needed for foursquare, that's why it isn't in the app store itself! it's not HootSuite's fault!",1
I am a tweetdeck fan but after using Hootsuite I have started to get over the fact that I can't have it on my Kindle. It's a great app and has several features I like better than tweetdeck. Downloading this app is just like getting married to your second,1
horrible game.. to confusing and doesn't even tell you what to do.total waste of time ..would not recomend .not even worth downloading,0

"Chances, your answer is ""no."" If you answered the other way, you might love this app. Its got a huge ad every time youbopen it, two more on the title screen, and yet another one for you while you play! Oh, and what a game playing experience you will have",0

BUY IT! get it free right now out of this world. yo :) or if you don't which you should but it doesn't. matter anyway ok ok as I was saying if you don't. like it here it is :( babem,1
I waited for 10min. and I am already dead right there.  then I waste my time playing because it keeps doing the same damn thing gosh!,0
This app only does one thing.  You think of a number between 1 and 99 and  it &#34;guesses&#34; your number by process of elimination.  it's a trick that any 3rd grader could do.,0
Get a grip people maybe the s in games refers to you playing multiple times. The app does what it's supposed to do albeit in a bare bones way. The description tells you exactly what it does and it's only  two sentences not one of which is &quot;You won't,1

I moved to a different state and I was so glad to find this app couple months ago.  I never miss my favorite morning show.  Looking forward to recording now great for my busy mornings when I can't really pay attention to the radio.,1
I use this app more than any other. Runs without crashing. TuneIn is always updating app. Well worth the inexpensive price. Could use some tone controls or an equalizer.,1

I've seen some negative reviews for this recent update in other places. I updated it none the less. I like to judge for myself. One big critique was about the addition to add social media - Facebook and sharing what you listen to. I see nothing wrong wit,1

"This free app has all of the features you need to play Sudoku. The only limitation is that there are only 300 each of the different difficulty levels. Fortunately, by the time I get through all 300, I can start at the beginning again because I have total",1
"I enjoy crossword puzzles, and sudoku is very entertaining. I like the way one may increase the size and difficulty of each puzzle. This is a great free app.",1
"This one even highlights the same number in other squares and if you bump the wrong letter and it is an invalid option, it lets you know. You can shut off that hinting feature too. but I don't use it for cheating, just to catch when I have a fat finger. ",1
nothing fancy...there are ads during game play but they are not intrusive (and keep the game free).  AI also has other great games like Checkers and Reversi which link to free downloads from Sudoku.  This is one of the better Sudoku games with clean grap,1

I have tried multiple Sudoku Apps on multiple devices and I like this one the best!  It is very user friendly.,1
"First of all, free is always good.  Love the amount of puzzles and the different levels of difficulty this app provides.",1
It is perfect that you can always work with pencil mode. Then when you have enough solved you can quickly (just a tap or two) clear your pencil marks to leave the correct number. Play this at least once a day.,1

Basic sudoku.  Doesn't need internet to run which is my beef with some of the other versions.  It works for me.,1
Love being able to turn the clues on and off. Better than a paper and pencil approach. The only way to occupy your time on a plane.,1
I love the challenge of this game and for the most part know that every time I open it I will be challenged and usally will be successful in meeting that challenge.  I hate for a computer to beat me so this one is great as I will only beat myself.,1
SUDOKU IS A VERY CHALLENGING PUZZLE. MY DAUGHTER GAVE ME A PUZZLE BOOK BUT I THINK THIS SUDOKU GAME IS THE GREATEST.,1

I am addicted to this game.  I have a love/hate relationship with the fact that is doesn't let you cheat.  Or if it does I can't figure out how.  I play it all the time.,1
I've done Sudoku on paper for years and got to where I didn't enjoy it any more.  This digital version is such fun and gives so many different levels of difficulty.  I have been working on them since Christmas and still have not run out of new versions. ,1

didnt mean to get this game but i guess if u like sounds it is ok had a 4 and 6 yr old buggin me while downloaded game for them,0
I did not like it because it was not really a game and who would want to hear the sound of bowling pins being knocked down,0
For me the noise is accurate but just that.  Without active visuals it had no meaning for me and I got rid of it.,0
My grandson put this on my Kindle---he thought I needed it.  It is very annoying.  I guess it is ok if you like that kind of thing.,0
"I do enjoy playing this game. It is a learning process, learn how to focus,and think and learn how we shouldManage to win,win and win.",1
"this is a useless app, i did not order this unless my grand kids did, but i thought that you need my password to order and they are young kids and i am the only one who know my password. took it off my kindle. sad that i was charged for it!",0
my 3 year old granddaughter loves this and requested it be downloaded.  She loves the sounds and it seems to be a sensory enlightment for her.,1
"Cannot get it to play.  When I open the game, the pins are on both  sides. Right in the middle is a pin with the word STOP on it.No matter what pin I click on, it does not change.",0
I thought it was something else.  How do I delete it?  I don't want it on my Kindle.  Please advise.,0
"THIS APP STINKS,I want my money back, I guess it was my fault, I thought it was a game, my bad I guess.",0
I can't play it due to login messes and conflicting games.  What a pain.  Not even on my cellphone.  I can enter my user name and password and still get an &#34;invalid&#34; notice.,0
"I did not care for this game.  I was not very good at the rotations, so I could not get very far.",0
"Ironically, I have this on my BB Curve and it works fine. But I cannot get it to work at all on my Vizio tablet as some others have stated. It just will not work. It is free, however, so it might work with other tablets-just not the vizio.",0
This bar-code reader works faster and more reliably than the three others I've tried. It seems to capture faster by making better use of the camera features.,1

"THis is agreat little app.  It works like it should, and works on any Android 4.0 device.  Love the price (free).",1
It would not find the qr code on a few  that I tried it on . it just wouldn't work.,0
I want to get a barcode scanner for the Archos 70. This does not work for the antique tablet. I don't know what will work for old tablets?,0
"I needed this for barcode reading, but do not use it enough for a better rating, but I will now.",1
you can scan a barcode and it reads it but can't seem to find it anywhere.  I have a Verizon droid,0
It does work with my Acer Android tablet. Very fast scans compared to other apps. Could not get it to function with my Kindle maybe because of the front only lens makes it very hard to line up the code.,1
The my scan feature saves previous scans and can save a bunch of time if you want to look at previously scanned sites.  The app works well and is stable.,1

States that another application is reading on to the camera. Stopped all apps that read to camera and still getting the same statement. Uninstalled the app.,0
I tried to use this device on a magazine code and it took me directly to that magazine's web site.  I guess that is the purpose of this app.  Maybe in the future I will find more of a use for it. Try it; it was free.,1
"I TRIED FOR HOURS TO MAKE IT WORK. I WENT TO A CLASS ON  HOW TO USE MY NEW ANDROID, AND THE TEACHERS COULDN'T GET IT TO WORK.",0
"One of my discontents with Verizon is that they talked me into buying an LG phone, rather than the Droid I came in there for. Battery life is really bad on this one, if you want to have any screen time - but this application really helps. It is amazing w",1
"Really like this app.  It finds all the programs running in the background better than any other task killer I have used.  Very easy to use, and effective in freeing up resources.",1
It will not remove Google apps that are imbedded in a android tablet.  Downloaded apps can be uninstalled without this.,0
"I love having this app to close all of the running ones.  It's a must have to save battery life.  I have it on all of my android devices, can't do without it.",1
A great way to kill all of the open apps on your phone or tablet that you thought you had closed.,1
"Slows down the android processor from my experience, it does its job however so I guess you can't really complain.",0
Seems to speed up my Kindle fire when use it.  If it really saves the memory it says then it is truly worth it.,1
"This application does what it claims quite well & intuitively & for free. I can't think of a better compliment. Some nice features within. I must say, I've liked every app this developer has published.",1

"Not sure why the bad reviews. I really liked it. Works just like regular sudoku, but with a word to find.",1
"Only &quot;instructions&quot; are to click on empty space in the grid, but when do so nothing happens so unable to play.",0
"Wordoku is a sudoku-like game that you can play in two different ways. You can play it as a Sudoku with letters instead of numbers, or you can play it with the idea of only trying to solve the 9-letter word. I enjoy Wordoku more playing it like the latte",1
"Can't play on my galaxy tablet, nothing shows up on the main page to start to the game. Please fix, would love to try it.",0

I enjoyed it. It uses the same basic rules of sudoku but the object is to find the hidden word within the puzzle. Once you've found it you've beaten the level but can continue and fill it in sudoku style to completely beat the level or move onto the next,1
this app froze up on the title screen the first few times I loaded it.  finally got passed the title screen only to have it freeze on the game screen.  and I can't get to any type of menu.,0
Either it doesn't work on tablets or it is too hard to figure out how to start a game. Can't get past the first screen.,0
"My girlfriend got so frustrated playing this game she threw my phone across the room. I don't have insurance on  it, so I'm glad it didn't break, or it would have cost $700 to replace.I tried it myself thinking how bad could it be. After 5 minutes of pla",0
Terrible game. I was happy to see an alternative to sodoku but this ruined it. Just play sodoku instead of this poorly executed game.,0
Not like sudoku at all. Every puzzle should only have one solution. The very first Wordoku I tried was not solvable because it had multiple possible solutions.,0
"I remember when Sudoku first came out and it wasn't met well, then all of a sudden it became an instant classic.",1
"I've never been able to figure out regular Sudoku, and that made me feel dumb. I understood the logic behind it, but I could never solve even the simplest puzzle.Now I realize that I AM smart, I just don't dig numbers. Dug! Already knew that! With Wordok",1
there are only a few glitches but they don't make the hours of fun and destruction any worse. I loved the original on the computer and I'm so glad its now an app.,1

Finally a search engine that don't give me what they think I want accordingly to my previews searches. It always give me what I need on the first page. It is like a search engine that is not bias.,1

The &#34;heads up&#34; on &#34;free range&#34; pop-ups me off from using this. Is there a source for the Musical Times without pop-ups?,0
What a great way to keep up with the 'goings on' in the Homeland!  Definitely a must have.  I love it.,1
I am so happy I tried this on the day it was free. I would NEVER pay for this app. Four colours? Three shapes? Nothing extra like stencils or anything. Heck this is worse than the real thing (a white board) This is a pretty lame app with practically 1opt,0
Its a whiteboard for the phone or tablet and it acts like one with the added advantage of saving.  Perfect.,1
only handwritten note taking app that is usable.  a must have for any student.  I would recommend the ability to continue writing on a new board and save all the images on one file....but overall incredible app.  would have paid more for it!,1

i love it i think it is awesome but that is my opinion post your opinion.and this is annabell i don't get this kindle fire.,1

"very nice app, and agree that the whiners need to get over whatever it is they think is wrong.  is there a way to input text? didn't notice it if there is. would be nice to put text descriptions in the shapes.... I prob just overlooked the feature?",1

I love it so much that my mom can't take my kindle away from me. Don't listen to any other review. I am telling the truth.,1

Tomorrow I am going to alphabetize my sock drawer. I am always getting in trouble for balancing fine china on the tips of pencils. Bananas are nature's sex toy. Imagine a world without ladders.,1

"This works great with the s-pen, would be nice if they added s-pen pressure vs. marker size support, but I'm not complaining in any way. Thank you for a good app",1
"This is a simple whiteboard app. It is fairly basic, but that I what I think makes it so great. Afterall, it is no more complicated than the whiteboard I have at my office. I used a tablet pen on this and it worked great. I'd recommend it for a dollar!",1
"Is it basic? I guess that would be a fair view. What I see is a very responsive app for tablet presentation. The app has whiteboard in the name, of you want to draw this might not be the app for you, if you want to create some basic presentation or desig",1
"For the longest time this app was incompatible with my Kindle Fire HD. Since it's become available for my Kindle, I've used it a lot to keep a toddler entertained, and to keep track of my school assignments.",1

this is like the 50th doodle app in the last month! come on amazon! it seems like if its not an arcade space game or doodle app its not free....give something useful or at least a different type of game.,0
Very simple. Very useful. Downloaded fine on HTC Incredible running 2.3.4. Easy to use. Good for both myself &amp; my daughter. Enough said. Just try it out.,1
I am always in need of a whiteboard and this is sweet. Has 4 colors which is enough to draw accordingly. I am an engineer and having to explain solutions or concepts to clients require lots of free space. Not to mention being able to export and share so ,1

I love Whiteboard Pro.  Amazing how something so simple could be so cool.  The tools are very basic.  Use freehand lines or the straight/square/circle tools.  The color and width of the lines are adjustable.  There is an eraser and an undo/redo function.,1

This tools great for tracking my walks. I love that you can track distance and speed. I also like that you can save and upload your walks.,1

I love this app! I like that I can write with my finger or type on the page if I choose. Since I type fast it would be great if the app wouldn't lag behind. I recommend this app for anyone who likes to keep notes or journals. I currently have this app ru,1
Wait till 12:30am for app to b free!  2:30am central time.This app is exactly what I have been looking for!  I never have anything to write with and the main thing I miss from my old phone was notepad.  Thanks to the dev and to amazon for a useful FAOTD ,1

This app is not working out for me. I have tried several times and my notes just look like unreadable scribbles. I need a writing app where I can use the keyboard. It is possible you can do this with this app but I have not figured out how to do so.,0
Works great on my HTC Incredible. So much faster than typing on regular notepad with the keyboard. Finally an alternative to the standard notes app! Better grab this free app of the day while you can. Once you try it you'll agree it's well worth the pric,1

personally I love this app! It is easy to use and if I'm in a hurry to write myself notes or Xmas ideas it comes in handy. I think it is worth the money. I haven't found too many other apps like this that work well. love it!!!,1
This really took time to try to understand.  Not useful so deleted it and will look for another option that will be better,0
This app is great! I had been looking for just this type of application to use on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I am testing it on my Motorola Zoom while I await the arrival of the Fire 8.9. I love the user interface. I also like the many available paper option,1

worth getting. very useful. helps to have a stylus but it isn't necessary. I like it a lot. definitely a good buy.,1
Nice app...super fun to play with but....I regret paying almost 4 dollars for it.....I wish there were a free version,1
This app is not worth it! There is an app called &quot;Notepad&quot; by Michael Checca. It is much better and it is free. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! Go &quot; Notepad&quot;!!! And boo &quot;Handrite Note Pro&quot;!!!!!,0
I mainly use this app  to take notes. Its simple and quick enough that I can write notes on the fly before I forget as I'm not thinking about what button to press. definitely a unique app.,1

When I have a thought in my head or something I have to remember I can quick jot it down on this by using my keyboard or using my finger to write.  It works very well and in an intuitive fashion.  Easy to use.,1
Works great.  Doesn't convert your writing to text but enters your handwriting on a tablet.  I will use this when my 5 year old asks me how to write a letter or number.  Definitely gets a spot on one of my screens for quick access.,1
"this app is really cool I love it! literally, you write something out with your finger and it puts it on a notepad, exactly as how you wrote it. kudos to the developer! I love free app of the day! :)",1
I think that this is a great app once you take the time to learn how to use it. You can use your fingers to write or the keyboard to type your message. This is replacing my other note app.,1
This app does what it says. I keep a widget on one of my screens for quick notes. I was always fumbling in my purse for pen and paper. Great for times when you need to jot down a phone number quickly.,1
This is a very handy app when you need to jot something quick.  It is also helpful when you need to use nonstandard characters.  You can incorporate small drawings and such.,1

Being a simple note pad is a necessary thing for a smartphone. This app is great because it allows you to write your own notes in your own handwriting and then scales the word down to fit reasonably on the note sheet. Definitely easier than fiddling with,1

I put this on my kindle fire and I enjoy this game a lot.  You get started and then you just want to keep trying to get farther.,1
I love this game. Most of the screens are challenging and you aren't tied up for a long time playing a game.,1
"This is a fun and entertaining game. I can spend many hours playing this game, it is a lot of fun.",1
oh this is a fun timed game where you have to move the cats into the house from the field--lots of fun ! offers several fun levels--very enjoyable.,1
This app works perfectly! And the devotional is excellent! Anything billy gram makes is outstanding and this man deserves the up most respect!,1
I always loved to hear and read Billy Grahams messages. This Devotional is short and to the point. I enjoy it very much.,1
So far this app will not install on my Nextbook 7s which is an android 4. I would love to be able to use it. Billy Graham is probably the greatest preacher of all time. Hopefully there will be an update soon.,0
This program never downloaded.  I tried several times and have not been able to get it to download so I have been very disappointed in not being able to view the app.,0
I have not been able to download it . It would be a great app because I have it on my phone & I love it.,0
Great game could play forever however loses something in the carry over to the kindle why I don't know but its a little different then the computer game that we all know and love,1
This app is not what I was expecting it to be. I could make myself keep it and it really seems to be lacking. Should really remake it and try to keep it simple like the original Dope Wars.,0
Worst remake I've ever seen of this game. Idiotic attempt at this game. garbage game from an amateur out to try and make a cheap buck and an insult to the original game.,0
This pizza app was easy to download and install. It contains all the local pizza places and connect you to their order site.,1
this waste of time is not an app at all. It just directs you to a web page which as far as I can tell does absolutely nothing at all. FAIL.,0
Not too many coupons available in my area...kinda disappointed....hopefully they will change and more will become available in the future.,0
This is not a pizza app.  I installed it based on it's claim to be from Papa Johns.  All it does is take you to a web page with coupons.,0
Pretty useless app I downloaded by accident while looking for the actual dominos app.  Doesn't do anything.  Get the dominos app instead.,0
I order dominoes pizza often and the app works just fine.check it out yourself and see,1
I order dominoes online and this saves time having to log on my computer.  I can just sit with my kindle and order.,1
This is not a great app. You can do better without it.I've already deleted it from my device. Too many steps required.,0
I just can not figure out how this app works. I often play Siduco on a hand held game. But cannot eve complete the first game here. I would not buy again nor recommend it.,0
Downloaded free to one and the paid version to the other. Both  are very similar. Hundreds of games to play with several levels. An endless source of entertainment.,1
"My husband is a former math teacher, and he really enjoys suduko.  I wasn't sure he would like the Kindle version of suduko, however he spends hours working on Kindle 's suduko.  I highly recommend it.  Amy",1
The directions for this game are difficult to figure out.  I have given up trying. Give me paper and pencil instead.,0
Sudoku is one of the most challenging games I've every done.  I play it almost every day and am getting pretty good at it too.,1
I rate this game to the highest!!  Anyone that love numbers and puzzles will truly love this one.  Have fun with Sudoku!!,1
I play Sudoku in my own time and the competition is one on one ME against ME. I've had three or more Sudoku games loaded on my Android pad for months and they all have their good and bad points; playing all of them and grading them head to head this game,1
Very easy to play and user friendly. Numbers that are no longer in play are not illuminated and that is a plus in my opinion.,1
"My wife plays this all the darn time on her phone. I had put several Sodoku games on her phone (SG3) and she said this one was the best by far. She really liked it and when I told her we should get the paid one she said ""Don't need that, I don't mind the",1
"Simple and straight forward.  It only plays in portrait though and that makes it hard to hold.  Don't improve  it too much, pleses",1
I absolutely love this color version on my Kindle Fire! Many levels/games to play! Could not be happier!! Would recommend this game to all my friends!!!,1
Love Sudoku. It keeps my mind nimble and sharp. Have it on my home computer in various versions. So happy to be able to take it with me now!,1
"Though well intended, the game does not function correctly.  I can not fill in the possibilities, and sometimes cannot get rid of the small numbers in the blocks.  This is a waste of time! I would not recommend that anyone purchase this game.",0
I am enjoying Sudoku very much.  This app is easy to use and works very well.  Glad to have the app on my Kindle.,1
Any game by AI factory works well on the Kindle Fire HD. I buy them all because they work and are beautifully designed. These are just the best time wasters around. This Sudoku has great features that make playing much more exciting and there are more ga,1
I play this several times a day when I was some fun brain stimulation.  I highly recommend this one to all Sudoku fans.,1
This is a favorite game of mine and my husband as well..will get lots of use out of this game I am sure.,1
"If you have the time to waste and have no capacity to regret the misuse of this life's most valuable non-renewable resource, then perhaps this is your app.",0
This is a fun game.  I have always liked sudoku puzzles.  Great way to pass the time and use your head.,1
"In school I was never really good at math so I didn't expect I would like this game, but I got b/c a friend recommended it to me.  I tried it for about a week and couldn't even complete the first puzzle.  This game needs a puzzle help option where you ca",0

"I love Sudoku, and this is one of the best apps for the game I have seen.  It has different levels and at least 300 games for each level.  You can also re-play games to improve time/score.Very good app!",1
This is a Great game if you have a little time waiting for your appointments as you can start and resume later if need be,1

"I love Sudoku and have used books for years, but this edition for my Kindle Fire HD is just awesome. I especially love the ease with which you can enter or delete numbers in a certain square. I would recommend this to all Kindle Fire HD owners.",1
"This is a really good sudoku.  Easy to navigate.  Easy to correct.One thing I really like is that if you select a 2, all the twos on the board light up: makes it easier to see the number patterns.Good for side-by-side play, too.  My Mom and I play this g",1
"The ability to try a guess when you are stumped, and the ability to enter different simultaneous possibilities for a particular cell are great.  Being able to erase, back-up, and save a game for re-play later are all a plus.",1
"Within the game package is a lot of games, 300 per each of the four levels. I am working the easy set now but am gaining confidence in moving up to level 2",1
Great game. this is addicting. Love the numbers and the hints. would recommend this one to everyone. Get those brains working!,1
I like this version of Sudoku for Kindle Fire.  It is easy to use and very fun.  I am impressed with AI Factory's work.,1

Didn't work very well if at all. It was hard tosend and even harder to figure out after awhile.I gave up after several tries.  I got a far moresimpler app with less promises and it wasgreat.,0
Different versions of solitaire. A game for any card player. A very satisfying play. Hope you enjoy as much as I have!,1
Who doesn't love solitaire? Easy to load to your Kindle; you'll be playing right away. It was free. What's not to like?,1
Can't figure the game out.for nothing. I am a solitaire player and love to play different ones but forget this one.,0
All the pictures of the cards show the numbers on the card.  But when you attempt to play the cards only have the value of the cards in the corners and the suit icon in the middle.  Hard to see the values.,0
This product does not work at all. If you try to move a card the only place it goes is into the free cells. It is a non starter-avoid it.,0
I am lookin for more graphics n this is very simple.  Will keep looking.6 more words are required for submission,0
easy to use. Just the perfect variety of games. not cluttered with games I don't like. Just has the ones I love to play. Works great.,1
I like to play solitaire because its a game to chanellenge your mine.Yes I would recommend this game. And the reason why is because its a nice relaxing game to play,1
"This free app was a disaster--I was under the impression that there was more than one version of solitaire, and I couldn't find any, and there is no solution to a bad game.  I came up against a dead end and the game just sat there and did nothing, no war",0
so far so good. it has four card games instead of one. I have this same app on my cell phone.,1
Like this app a whole bunch. Easy to navigate through. Graphics are great. App works well on the Kindle Fire.,1
This app. Is best suited for the veiwer who wants news and weather updates quick and percise. I use it every morning before Ileave my home. I do not find the traffic component very useful. A less confusing upgrade is needed.,1
This is the best local news app I have and the although it can be a little fuzzy at times the Live Stream is very dependable and gives you the exact times it will be on.,1
Fox 45 covers local news very thorough and they are complimented by nation news by the Fox News National parent outlet.,1
"Love fox45 news, gives me latest stories on my kindle! Wished they had more local news apps on android app store!",1
"When i watch news, this local Baltimore, tv station is one of my favorites. They give quality news and weather, i watch them everyday on tv or my tablet and their app has worked very well on my 9&#34;Zto Tablet and my 7&#34;Matricom Tablet. I will keep t",1

not what I thought it was. just like the previous rating. should be more to it and less of the advertising,0
I only watch WSYX ABC6 because they give the most honest news. I like the news and weather people. I think thhey enjoy what they are doing.,1
"This app works great.  Keeps me informed quickly.  I like to check apps in morning and evening for many items.This app fits my ideals and views, and is very easy to read and I love it.",1
"Fits galaxy tab screen. Pretty basic but glad they made it. Has videos, blogs and photis. Readable ad free content.",1
"Very interesting topics, especially the ones not found in the news.a good place to find out what is going on the world",1
This is probably my favorite news app. It gets updated often - you never have to read stale news - and they really get in depth covering all sides of all issues. Politico is not afraid to go after both sides unlike the Huffington Post which attacks mainl,1
This app is great.  I've become a news/opinion junkie with this app.  It's a snapshot of timely issues and opinions.,1
This app is just wonderful. It gives you a quick headline. You may go to a more in-depth article if you choose. A great quick way to keep up on current events.,1
"Superior political news source even if the app seems a tad bland -- there is no modern glitz (not altogether a bad thing) usually have to update manually, but that is a small price to pay for solid perspective and well-written news and an app that doesn'",1
Slow app and does not update. questionable reporting at best and hack jobs for left at worst. I dont recommend it at all.,0
Uninstalled.  It requires too much potentially sensitive information for it to run.  It would be nice if it worked without needing access beyond the internet. Too bad.,0
"Keeping it real, this review is only for the app itself. Works great, loads fast, never freezes. Can't really complain about it.",1
"Great app to have,  just love the up to date information about political situations and what is happening in the world today.",1
"This is a dead on game play reporter of the D.C. follies from POTUS, allies and Congress Critters.  They don't pull punches and are dead on and usually 3-14 days ahead of what gets reported as 'current news'.",1
Having practiced reflexology for many years I jumped at the chance to get an app like this on my fire. It's helpful to have acupressure right at my fingertips so to speak.,1
love this product..it is soooo easy to use. you cant go wrong with it whether use know about acupressure or not,1
"amateurish at best.........................young people might be sparked into learning about it, but the methodology exhibited is not relevant or pertinent to anyone seriously contemplating the use of acupressure",0
"A very good app that has many versions of physical massage to applyon everyday problems like leg pain, headaches etc.  I highly recommendalso wish they would do one for feet",1
"I use this app several times a week for backache - have also had great relief using it for headache,  wrist pain and toothache.  I would rather use this than pop pills!",1
Best app yet. Easy download. Good instructions and got good results. Most pleased with this app. Buy this app. It will not disappoint.,1
for some reason this book didnt download and because i am new to this kindle thing I dont know what to do about it,0
maybe to much information for the lay person .  to hard to figure out exactly where to press c could be dangerous.,0
I've had this app for at least a year. Still have it on my phone and still refer to it frequently for various techniques and have recommended to others. Money well spent. Good value.,1
I tried some of the procedures it recommend to relieve a headache but apparently I didn't do it right. I ended up with a migraine that lasted for 2 days.I also noticed the same procedures and pressure points were recommended for various conditions. Not r,0

this app has come in handy more than once. great tool to have on your phone. i use it to convert data size a lot but it has a lot of different units it can convert,1
Sorry to all the 1 stars that this is not a game. Do not give things a bad review because its not for you. If that's the case wait for tomorrow...it will be a game again. It's nice to see something useful! Simple to change converter type and works great.,1
I use this app on a daily basis. It's easy to use on my phone's smaller screen but also works great on my tablet.,1
I've had many of this sort of app on a variety of PDAs and smartphones going back to the Palm III in the mid-1990s.  This is probably the nicest conversion app I've used to date.  Not much to say other than how nicely it groups the various units of measu,1
Very simple and easy to use! You can set up your favourites that use a lot or are more common in your area/country. Waiting for the update to keep favourite tab open first instead the &quot;all-tab&quot; You'll definitely use this app! Very convenient!,1

"this is just to offset the idiot complaining that the volume section doesn't have grams, how would you convert that parent of a special needs child?",1
This is one of the best apps I have downloaded.  It's easy to use and will convert almost anything.  Used it daily while traveling in Europe so I would know exactly what I was spending in US dollars.  Would definitely recommend!,1

"I just downloaded a similar app from another well known app place, but this one does what I want and more.",1
I can find so many uses for this app. It has a smooth and fast interface. Way better than even the stock calculator has. One of the best productive apps out there.,1

I like all the options it provides. I have thought of many idea for this app already in my mobile food truck : The Twisted Sister House of Hunger.,1

"another disappointing game, I do not play this one I' am so sorry I got this game, I took it off m y list",0
I enjoy this game a lot!  You connect a series of dots until all dots are connected.  The only negative thing I could say about this game is the voice that yells at you when you make a wrong move.,1
this app is wicked. it is sooo fun and addicting. u should really get this app. it works really good on the kindle fire just to let other kindle fire owners if they are interested. but seriously......u should get this app.,1

It makes my thirteen year old's &#34;brain work.&#34; She and i both enjoy it. Trace the lines throughout a drawing without crossing over a line multiple times. Becomes increasingly more complex. Graphics are aglow and kiddos like that as well.,1

After I started using it my phone started rebooting randomly.  And when I uninstalled every thing went back to normal.,0
don't bother with a space wasting battery eating program that is inferior to others and looks like an older ad-free version. your os already does it is better. where do these crazy promos come from?,0
There is no reason for this app. All of this is or can be done much better. Dev just taking advantage.,0
this app works great for me. thanks Amazon for offering it for free. i actually prefer this app to the last utility app that i had. user friendly interface and easy to figure out for the most part.,1
"Yes Android phones can do what this app offers. The app isn't magic, it just makes things a couple clicks easier to find. Instead of hunting through settings. It all right there one click. Pretty much for people that are not tech savvy and things easy.",1

This game is a lot of fun and it is absolutely worth a buck. It is a unique puzzle game that will keep you entertained. Highly recommended.,1
"I don't play a lot of computer games. I almost never play games on cell phones. But when I saw this as the Free App of the Day, I snapped it right up. I had played a more sophisticated PC version of this game a few years back, and was hooked.This is a lo",1
The graphics are very basic but the game is easy to learn once you start playing around with it. I like that it is a very smart game and that there are multiple solutions. If you are up for a brain challenge then I would say that this game is definitely ,1
"This is a great game! I&apos;ve played similar flash games before, but this version improves on them. I&apos;m glad it is the free app of the day, but after playing it, I would gladly pay for it...",1
"Could&apos;ve sworn I played this game before; but must have been thinking of something similar. None the less, this is a great game. Ramps up nicely and doesn&apos;t simply throw you to the wolves; nor does it treat you with kid gloves. Also a good way ",1
"a excellent time waster,  great puzzles and its absolutely perfect for the train ride into the city.  an A+ application on the original droid.",1
The game is pretty fun and so far from what I can tell it is kinda like the puzzles used to open crates in Gameloft&apos;s Nova. Now I have a rooted htc EVO with cm7.0.3.1(if you don&apos;t know what that is well maybe google it and find out it&apos;s wa,1
This is a nice mellow puzzle game for when you don&apos;t have a lot of time.  Puzzles are well thought out and challenging not frustrating.,1
wasn&apos;t sure the first few levels but now it&apos;s gotten personal. I have been. cracked out on this for hours,1
"Takes a couple levels to get the hang of the controls but easy afterwards. For those that said it&apos;s too hard too quickly, well the world needs ditch diggers too. Seriously, it might just not be your type of game. Don&apos;t ask them to dumb it down ",1
"Refraction is a great, addictive logic puzzle game.  It starts off pretty easy, but quickly moves on to much more complicaed levels.  Very fun game--definitely worth the $0.99 price.",1
"Got this as free app of the day but I&apos;d happily pay for this ($0.99 is a steal)!  Game looks easier than it is, but that&apos;s not a bad thing!  It&apos;s just challenging enough! Definitely try it out!",1
"This &quot;game&quot; has given me many hours of fun!  I say game, but it&apos;s much more than that, it&apos;s also a good mental workout.  I&apos;m a programmer and games like these keep my brain sharp.  For me the first 3 levels were a really easy, bu",1
This IS my Go-To game of preference - I prefer it to anything similar or dis-similar out there!  I love it and wish they would add more levels!,1

I started playing this game and then told my husband about it so he could join in on the madness. Now I have to try to drag him away. It's addictive and employs sometimes thinking about things in ways you weren't expecting.,1
This is one of the best executions of this style game I have ever seen. The puzzles are unique and require thought but are not so difficult they can&apos;t be solved (yet). Love this app!,1
"I picked this app up when it was the free app of the day, but it is definitely worth more then the $.99 this dev is charging. It&apos;s fun, challenging, and well made.",1
"It's a fun puzzle game that's challenging without being too frustrating. The components are simple - colored beams of light, mirrors, and prisms which split the light beams in two. You have to guide the beams of light to the same-colored targets. It star",1
"This is a fun and clever game but it takes a while to get interesting.  After about 30 levels I was ready to call it quits because the levels didn't feel challenging, just tedious.  But shortly after this the difficulty ramps up-- the boards are more con",1
"The concept is simple, the channenge is simple enough to split light beams and then recombine them.  I have enjoyed this app so much as a way to pass time and for 99 cents I highly recommend it to everyone.",1
The app does not become free until 3:15 AM EST.  That&apos;s 12:15 AM PST for those of us who can&apos;t understand what a time zone is. \n\nThe app itself. It&apos;s hilariously fun. Definitely worth getting. Goofy and fun to play.,1
"Like portal, this game offers exactly what you expect, a bunch of fun puzzles that make you think, but are solvable. You get more than enough pieces to accomplish a puzzle so there are countless ways to beat each level. Yet the limited amount of space fo",1
"A great little puzzle game that plays on colors and their interactions.  This might have a chance of being difficult if you&apos;re colorblind, but even then still worth a try.",1
This game is really interesting and entertaining. It requires you to think and it&apos;s frustrating yet rewarding. Controls are pretty obvious and practical.,1
"This is an awesome game that gets progressively harder as you advance.  I got this as a Free App of the Day, but would have definitely bought it if necessary.  Thanks!",1
simple concept but the puzzles are very fun. some of them are quite easy others took me a long time to figure out. great game to pull out when I only have a few minutes. I hope to see a sequel.,1
"this is the most fun of any the brain teasers I have tried on google android.  if you like brain teasers and don&apos;t like this it&apos;s not the program it&apos;s you.  It it is very challenging . You can use it in shorts stents, but I found it very h",1
Great Time stealer ! Will not Disappoint  Still have not gotten passed the first level.  Has me thinking in my sleep how to solve!,1
"Love this game for its puzzle solving and critical thinking. Keeps me entertained, and is a great learning game for my son. Works perfectly on my Epic 4G.",1
This is a fun puzzle game in which you use mirrors and prisms to align and change colors to solve the puzzles. The difficulty of the levels range from easy to pretty difficult. This game is fun and works perfect on the kindle fire. Great value at .99 cen,1
I've actually had this game for quite a while when the dev posted it in r/Android on Reddit a while back. I liked how during testing he got the input of the Android community there and made a lot of tweaks according to what users posted. Not a lot of Red,1
"I paid for this game a few weeks ago. Once I got the hang of it, you couldn&apos;t drag me away. Maybe now that it&apos;s free app of the day, people might start sharing screenshots online. Because some levels are tough.",1

"It's worth every single cent. Definitely a great time waster on your phone. Don't mistake this for anything other than a puzzle game, but I absolutely adore that each puzzle has multiple possible solutions, allowing you to piddle around, and work it out ",1
people need to learn two things before they download the daily free app...\n1. how to read\n2. patience\nso much fail in here,1
This is what a game should be...easy to learn but always a challenge as each new level gets progressively harder.  Fantastic!!!!,1
This is a very enjoyable bunch of logic puzzles.  They start easy enough but before long they really make your brain work to figure them out.,1
"great, fun and challenging game!! People, don&apos;t leave low reviews because you don&apos;t know how to read directions. I have a MyTouch4G (with a 3.5&quot; screen) and I can read them just fine. Keep it up devs!!!",1

It's 3D! As you move to different screens on your android device you get to see different angles of the fountain.,1
"This Wallpaper is really beautiful. It does do some damage to your battery life, but not as much as others I have used. The scene turns as you move through your home screens. As a proud Celtic, I have to say I love it!",1
I really liked the way this looks on my DROID2. smooth graphics with no lagging. I was willing to by the upgrade just to support them,1

"I'm searching and searching and searching for an app that will join the ringer, system and notifications volumes, but none seem to work for the S3.  this is about the 10th one I've tried today.",0
"OK, but cumbersome and time consuming to work with. I like only one or two clicks to make things work the way I want on my equipment.",0
I don't know everything this program does because I'm lazy that way. What it does for me is let me reset the volume on my phone with one touch. I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus and it is far too easy to change the volume on different things without even not,1

"My devise needed that extra boost, and this APP was just right!  It help give it a louder and more clear tone....",1
This is the best app for controlling the sound for every thing on the kindle every one that has one should get this app you will love it as much as I do,1
I was having trouble with my kindle and it wouldn't have a sound when a app was done downloading and it had a mute sign at the top right but the sound was turned all the way up .when I downloaded this app I found almost every thing about the volume has i,1
I've deleted this app after 6 months because it wasn't helpful for me.I had hoped it would allow me to boost the volume on my Kindle Fire at those times that I need it.I heard no difference from before or after.,0
This is definitely the answer if you're having volume issues with your android/tablet. The volume gets loud enough for headphones and even loud enough to hear across the room in my case. Not bad. A quick warning however is that music can get really loud ,1
I only wish that I had internet on my phone to download it because the App on my Kindle Fire is so much easier to use then the tool on my phone.  You just cannot beat the price - free.,1
"Simple and easy to use. Perfect for my Kindle Fire, I use Google voice for texting on it and the notification sounds were never loud enough.",1
"wasteful app for a kindle.  Don't bother, don't waste your time downloading & installing.  Completely unnecessary.  If you are having trouble with your volume, this won't fix it, there are other solutions.",0
"This is a very nice free app but it doesn't do anything you couldn't do yourself.  It does, however, make changing the volume much easier since all the controls are in one spot so I give it five stars.",1

I was skeptical until I tried it. Fantastic applications and the type that needs to be app of the day more often. Put the circle widget on screen and select applications. Then when you tap it they show around the circle and you can launch.,1

I love word games and used to play bookstore yahoo. I lose track of time playing this game! I just recently downloaded it but so far no complaints! Great job.,1
This game leaves a lot to be desired for someone who enjoys word games.  The dictionary is poor and there is little to no challenge.,0

nothing to do you just sit there and set timers and alarms for stuff to do. and there os somethings on there I would not want a 2 or 3 year old to see!! and pictures!!!!,0
for all the people who say its boring this is not a game. This is to help with child care. So don't hate you haters. and again its not a game.,1
I had an infant in the NICU for 3.5months. This app can be set to remind you to pump (which is what I used it for) as well as other cares for the baby such as meds. I will continue to use it when the baby comes home.,1

"if y'all think that this is a game... its not!!  if you would go back to the description,  it says that it keeps track of sleep,  eating etc... DO NOT GET IF YOU DONT HAVE AN INFANT TO CARE FOR!!",0
Sooo friggin useful; especially for a free app. It has many useful features. It makes keeping track of baby's habits much easier. I use it to help me remember which side I nursed on and to keep track of how often she eats.,1
"For being a first time mom this app sure does help out and remind on feeding times, diaper changes, and the other things needed to do :)",1
I just love this app it keeps up with everything. no more forgetting what time baby ate or how much how often or how many it keeps up with it all.,1
"This app was a great tool to use when my daughter was first born. We used it to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, and her doctor appointment stats. We still use it to track her height/weight and love this app!",1

i was shocked to see that this game is exactly like the game i use to play at the arcade 27 to 30 years ago. its fun and its challenging. i recommend it to those who like a challenge.,1
The screen is sooooo tiny! Too hard to play. Find a different version elsewhere if you want to play this game.,0

this game is the best frog you could ever bye!!! totally worth 0.99 cents!!! if you have the money I definetly reccomend this game for you!!!:) :) :),1
I loved this game since I first had it on my laptop - I have been trying to get past the first level and it is hard - it is harder to play on the kindle but I still love it - second level here I come,1
why people never happy with the free app of the day???? cmon people its free .if you don't like it don't download it.,1
This is a good game and fun trying to keep the frogs from getting smashed and to get to the other side. You got to get it now!,1
"This game brings back memories of the original game, with a kick! I could sit and play for hours, if I had the time!",1
"I was happy to see this classic as the free app, but even for a free app this sucks. The controls are bad, the game is slow, runs only in the portrait mode and add to that it malfunctions - even after I exited the game the background music kept going on ",0
Really?  Why would a game like Frogger need my FINE location data?  Is the game going to use this information to simulate frogs running across MY street from my home to my neighbors!  I don't think so.  Unacceptable invasion of privacy!,0
I should have listened to the reviews. The controls are to slow. You get killed every time. If you're bored it might be ok.,0
"Sorry folks, no game should need the &quot;discover known accounts&quot; permission. Fine targeted advertising (using my GPS and draining my battery) is bad enough. Swiping my email addresses, Facebook ID and Twitter ID so you can spam me without telling",0
"Runs great on galaxy tab.  Fun and levels get hard enough for me.controls are ok. Just like old times, just nt as expensive",1

"I found this very confusing.  Also, it seemed to require buying weapons to use. I wasn't sure so I deleted it from my Kindle Fire.",0
i also like this game. cause it is from the original atari. its just like what i grew up with. its fun.,1
I think Amazon should make sure that the games they let on the Kindle-Fire works this game I have never been able to play I clicked on new game nothing happen so I have bought this game for nothing.,0
As a kid of the 80's I got really excited when I saw this available. But it is horrible to play. The controls are difficult and the darn frog would die for no reason now and then. I gave up and uninstalled in frustration. AVOID!,0
I love this game.I had it on the original Atari and also on X box.This app is just like the old  game and is easy to play.I would recommend it to everyone!,1
"Not like the old Atari game, but still entertaining. Of course the graphics are 10x better, but if you are going for old school this is different.",1

It reminds me of the old frogger game from years ago. Very challenging and loads of fun for everyone to enjoy.,1
My husband really likes this game.  It can be challenging and he likes to be able to get farther against other opponents.,0
One of my favorite games on my HTC sensation. no problems with lag at all. great classic look. love it! don't listen to all the whiners who complain about graphics. this isn't halo for gods sake. its a basic and fun arcade game!!,1
"First of all, to all of the 1 star ratings who are whining about ""unexplained deaths""...The reason that you are dying is because each frog has a time limit to get across the road,so if you don't want to die, then pay attention and learn to play before yo",1
"Love this app.  It's just like playing the original, but with phone controls.  The graphics make it a classic instead of trying to improve something that already has fans in its original state.  Also, for the complainers that say they keep dieing, perhap",1
"yeah, I am not seeing any other difficulties others are complaining about. It took me a sec to figure out I had to swipe to move to us otherwise it is easy to use. Good simple game, probably a 4 star game but I gave it 5 to offset the asshats around here",1

I chose this rating because this game keeps me entertained & is very colorful. I also like the idea that this game is on the Kindle Tablet. & that I can take it with me wherever I go. There is nothing that I dislike about this game & I would highly recom,1
Old favorite of mine.  I enjoy using it and it brings back memories of the old days.  Thanks for the fun.,1
The game works great on my Thunderbolt! No issues at all. These other jokers either need a new phone with a bigger screen or are just simpletons. They certainly are not members of Mensa.,1
HTC Inspire 4G phone and this works great. Takes me back to my youth playing the game and now the next generation can be play. Graphics are just as primitive as they were back in the 80's but that's perfectly fine and adds to the experience by enhancing ,1
this game is just as i remember it in the arcades!! if i can recalls the the controls were crapy back then in the break danceN era so stop winning,1
Couldn't control the frog with my Kindle Fire.  The timing is off.  There is lag time between my direction and the frog's movement.,0
I was pleased to see this game is like the same as the old Atarigames were. I would like to see more of the old games come back,1
Just as much fun as other games that I played in the past.  Fast and mind boggling.  A good game to try.,1
this game is just not good I love the classic and though this game tryst to be that it is not the controls are just bad and this game has sooooooo much lag just don't buy this crap becomes games like this should not exist,0
"The description said it was from 1980! That's the 20th century.How would anyone still like that game now days? I mean, seriously this old stuff will not sell that well these days!!!!!!",0

"this version of frogger is awful! they buttons to.move the frog are terrible, which makes it very diffiicult to play. you also cant slide right  behind a car because it will kill you! don't waste the $1 on this game, waste it on something else!",0
"Starts playing repetitive sound, must reboot phone to stop. Glad it was free. More words words words. Nothing like real thing.",0

"Good game, like the original, but what the company does NOT tell you, i it is all on-line! Frogger online!? Never been heard of! Wish it WAS offline playable, but it isn't!",0
"OMG! Just hopping away with it. Still recent from buying this game, and anxious to get ALL of them into their caves. Well, looks like caves to me. Don't turn your head on this game. Well worth the stars!",1
After updating to Jellybean 10.3 from Samsung on my Galaxy S3 a small menu screen would come up but despite repeated key-presses nothing would happen.,0
"I wanted to stop playing because of the painful music, but after I exited and was back on my home screen the same stupid song kept playing.  Fixed that with an uninstall.",0
"classic, nuff said! If you don't like Frogger, stay away from this game auuuuughhhhh! For those of you who love the classics, ENJOY YOUR BUTTS OFF!!! Peace!!!",1
I don't understand negative reviews. The controls work fine with no lag. Some people complained that their frog would die for no reason...thats because there is a time limit.,1

Waste of time and yours just another app to keep you entertained for a few minutes that you will never get bake,0

This voice changer is great.  We have alot of fun with it. Try to record someone without them knowing and listen to it.  That seems to make it funnier.,1
I have used this to make custom ringtones for friends and family many times now.  Its also a great time kil with kids and fun to use to play tricks on people at parties.,1
Caused my phone to freeze up and reboot itself several times after install.  Pretty cool app otherwise.  This was on an HTC Incredible,0
This is really bad. First of when I tried to use the voice effects it wouldn't play. Then when I tried to exit out to the home screen it freezes. Really bad app I deleted once I got it :(,0

"This app is a waste of time, and very wired. I don't like what happens at the end. Very lame.",0
the app will never satisfy me even if this so called &quot;appzap&quot; company updates it the best thing about this app is the price,0
wow that's a little stupider!  who ever made this must be a total loser don't get it unless ur an ediot,0
Me and my cousin played with this for a while and it's really cute.  I didn't want him to push the red button and he kept on insisting.  Kept making us laugh.  Pretty entertaining in a crazy sort of way.  Fun to mess with.,1
This is the best game I have ever play see ya on the game Try this stinking game I'm worning you you will love it if you don't like this game suckit up because you will not like it you'll. love it Peace.,1
"You press a red button then it sends messages to you for doing it because you aren't supposed to.If you think the Sunday comics, a pie in the face gag, or &quot;America's Funniest Home Videos&quot; are funny ... then it might be for you.",0
it is so funny!If it said I will cut your head in a toothbrush kind of way I would laugh so much I would cry.,1
I don't like this game . Because this game does NOT have a touch of fun in it. Do NOT get it and all you do is touch one button then it will say STOP well of course I didn't stop so then it did 8 buttons. Then like 44 buttons please don't listen to the o,0
"This app is completely boring! I was expecting some scary face or something to pop-up in the screen, but this stupid app just repeats itself! It's no- doubt a 0 star app! In other words: DEFINITE TIME WASTER! D: not recommended for anyone with a life!",0
it is amazing but i think it says heaven blows up witch is horrable but other that that awesome super fun,1
THIS WAS THE BIGGEST TIME WASTER EVER IT SUCKED BIG TIME. IT WAS SO BAD MY REVIEW IS IN CAPS!!!!,0
this is so stupid it just says stuff like don't touch the button don't touch the button again if you touch the button 1more time the world.will explode don't install this app it sucks,0
this was the best app ever I laughed the whole time great job anyone who doesn't like this u don't know what fun is,1
it was fun at first but once I saw my daughter play it and it said that it would recommend suicide. and up to 9 layer of hell and that you exploded. heaven and hellI do not regimens for young children,0
this app is both inappropriate and quite intolerant because alot off its content is offensive and i highly recommend not to get this app,0
"I love this app. Its so addicting, yet so point less. I reccomend it for anyone that is bored and has nothing to do, or is just looking for a little humor. All you have to do is press a button. Its that simple! haha (:",1
ok that was a super fun game the part when it said boom a screamed but these ppl apparently. don't have a sense of humor they are stupid who ever made this game up THEY NEED TO make another game like this Ps don't waste your time looking for the white bu,1
To have lots of fun you have to read the text! For all of you who gave this app 1 star read the funny  TEXT!!!!!!!!! This game is very super fun!!!!!!!!!,1

Love this app! I think it is awesome. I did not want to put it down. it is good if you are bored. and it's free.,1
"Ok I don't know how I have  become addicted to this app but I will be honest.I'm addicted.The captions are a little funny. But I wish it would say something else if you don't press the button. Like, &ldquo;Thank you for not pressing this button&quot; or ",1
this app sucks. I lode it to my k fier and deleted. it right away all it did even. when u pushed. the button. is repeted its self &iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;,0
"This is by far the dumbest app I've downloaded yet. Don't press the red button, so of course you do. Then it has some smart alec remark at the bottom so you press it again. And again and again. That's it. That's all you do. Nothing else happens. WHY?????",0
This is so funny. It is AWESOME. I'm addicted. I had to play it like 5 times before came here and wrote the review.,1
"It's funny the first time. It's really cool to show to friends. But after that, it's pointless. Give it a try. You know you want to.How can people possibly complain over something free like this? Were they expecting something epic with a name like this?",1
all you do is press a bitten an seriously I'm its not even funny. &gt;:( I hate it it is so stupid.,0
Cool app it is so fun and funny I prefer it for you good time wasterGood bye see ya,1
I wrote one like this way back in the DOS days. I love it and very intelligent people I show it to can't put it down.,1
such a funny game! o laugh every time! P.S. PRESS THE RED BUTTON!!!!!  haha hahaha hahahahaha ha haha haha haha,1
"this button is solo funny! he is so random, too. but the funny kind of random. but he gets mean. but its funny when he gets mean because he says he will do things he is unable to do. seriously. I mean there's no way he could ever do the things he says he",1
i really didnt get this app at all the cover of the app may seem interesting but not as some of you would hope,0
Tried this just to see if it would work with the Droid X2. It does. But useless and boring program. In my opinion.,0
"very fun app. I don't know why people r giving it bad reviews, because this app just rocks. I would totally recommend it.",1
it is five star the first time u play but then stuiped.so u get play it delete that's what I did but u may not just get it it is funny,1
this app is so stupid it is amazingly hilarious! yeah it says some choiceful words but! it is supposed to be taken light heartedly! it is a red button for Pete sake! its not like it means it! I cracked up when I started to push the red button. it will ge,1
its a dumb App do not get it it tells u r gonna die and the world ending like wat the heck also to comit suicide and to go to hell and one more thing it SUCKS!!!!!!!!! don't wast ur time,0
great time waster and a good laugh. looking forward to the kids playing with and seeing they're reaction! BOOM! still looking for that white button though :P,1
The rules obviously say that you have to be 13 or older to leave a review. There are definitely younger children than that leaving them. There HAS to be a way to make sure that these ridiculous reviews are deleted or not even placed here. I have seen so ,0
at first its really funny well the whole first time u do it and the second time it gets old quick but I recommend getting lt its fun and if u donit to others to its goodz.,1
"Waste of time and space on your device. Don't download it, it's not fun at all. Even if it is free, you will regret wasting that time.",0
this is a very good app for killing time or giving it to a friend to press but the only rule... do not press the button,1
My friend has it on her ipod and when she let me play it I so wanted it. so I got it. if you want to get a funny app. get dumb ways to die it id HILARIOUS,1
"this app is hilarious I have to admit it, this a great time waster. it wouldn't be fun the second time though but that is the way it is I would like it to say different things.",1
hi my name is Elizabeth Chyenne Cline and I think this app is awesome and the most funest game that I have ever played in my whole entire life :) :) :) :b :p :v :o,1
I HATE THIS APP DO NOT GET IT. WASTE OF SPACE.ALL IT DOES IS INSULT U.THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE OVER 1 STAR ARE NOT SO SMART.AND THEY LIKE RUDE THINGS.PLEEEEEEEEAAAAAASE TAKE MY ADVISE AND DO NOT GET THIS APP,0
"Its so funny. You cant really do much with this app, but it just a fun app. After you read all of it, it just repeats and repeats.",1
"This app is THE ABSOLUTE BEST for curing boredom. Show it to your friends, and I am absolutely sure they will laugh. That is all there is to this hilarious app. So simple, and yet so funny. There is amazing character in the narrator, and the puns are THE",1
"And it doesn&apos;t get much better than that. It loops eventually, but the dialog is witty. Enjoy it, even one smile is worth it.",1
It is a waiste of download .  Do not download. It would be better if there alot of different colors.,0
"you just press the right button and that's all. I had it unistalled, I've got better things to do rather then just randomly press buttons. for some of you this app might be great, but for me it was pointless.",0
"a sense of humor. Don't bother. Not something *you're* going to play more than once, but cool to give to others. Earned its 5 stars it is what it says it is. Whatever you do however, DON'T PUSH THE RED BUTTON.",1
I like it but its has the h word in it but it is very funny and cool. So people who is reading this please play it please????Peace out home rommyes lol I love me!!! Am I fuuny??,1
"I'll tell you all you would want to know about his game. It sucks, the quality is disgusting, the buttons aren't even realistic, the &quot;harder&quot; levels stink. It's just a terrible game made for terrible people.",0
"...ALL DAY LONG! Seriously! AND, I recommended it to all my friends.How much productivity is being lost daily from just this one app?",1
it just loops back around when you are done. not fun at all. sorry but I am going to uninstall.,0
"all it does is say mean things to you. at the end of the story he tells you, it starts over and doesn't shuffle anything onceoever.",0
this game is stupid. i mean really stupid. i just tells you to keep pressing the button but nothing happens. at first i thought that the game was just an ad but no it wad the freaking game!! it sucked.so don't get it ....thank you and good nite,0
"Not interesting. Not inventive. If you have the attention span of a moth, you might find yourself continuously gravitating towards this app. If not then you, like me removed it from your device!",0
don't ever get this app because it says you a a moron so never get this app K never buy this app,0
"If you have about 10 minutes that you would like to kill then you should download this... play it for 10 minutes, and then delete it.  It's not worth the space to keep it on your device.",0
"this app is nit entertaining not is it funny. when I first saw it I thought I would just dismiss the bad reviews but it really is a pointless, useless, and non entertaining!!!!",0
"Dumb. There is no good reason to download this app.  Total waste of time. Sure, it 's harmless enough. And pointless.",0
"Do Not Press The Red Button.  Another mind game, albeit simple, to keep the mind active.  Good for all ages.  Time consuming and slightly mind numbing.",1
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! That is so funny I like the story at the end. Its a good app. And I'm glad its free,1
This is a SUPER STUPID app! I hate it! Its for like 3 year olds. That's all I have to say about this dumb app. Don't waste your time downloading thus silly app.,0
At first when I saw this I thought it be kind of like &quot;The Moron Test&quot;. I was thrilled since it was in the top 100 out of 10 THOUSAND apps!!! When I first played it I thought it was OK. It was when it repeated the same stupid conversation like ,0
i cant beleive it actually took longer to download this and install then it did to lose all interest in it.  then i continue to waste time to uninstall and write this review.  find something better to do with 5 minutes of your life.,0
What started off as semi-humorous QUICKLY became non-entertaining and boring. there's no point to this app. good thing it's free!,0
this app is totally inappropriate it keeps telling u to commit suicide and go to hell and that ur mother would hate you. not cool.,0
its really funny and its there when ur bored but y would u put the h word I mean wit if there r kids that got this app but I like it :p,1
its so fun my 10 year old daughter loves it but it says the H word but MUST GET IT!!!!!,1
this game has to be the most birding game I have ever played if you want to be bored to death by this game.,0
"its point less yes,  but very entertaining. Great time waster,  and really it can keep me entertained for hours. Is it because I'm an idiot? Nipper that's not it...",1
I loved it.....not terrible fun at first but omg terrible do not get it boring not fun at all well ok I exaggerated but it does get boring trust me even my 4 year old little brother hated it ok does that tell you anything a 4 year old hates a stupid game,0
"Some things are great pointless, but this app is definatly not one of them. Might be a little better if they could actually spell. Not even worth a free download.",0
u should totally get it its free and then it is awesome its very funny. thats wat its meant to be like u should at least try it!  :-],1
I hats this app I loaded itcand showed my friends and that wanted to brake tho prone wost game ever,0

this app is soooooooo funny in a dumb way its so irresistible to touch the red button *urk *. I'm 13 and its really fun for everyone over my age because it has swears.,1
this is so stupid I would rate zero if it let me I suggest Oregon settler instead buy that game,0
This app is more than useless. It was a waste of bandwidth to even download it. I want my MBs back!,0
this thing is so dumb I didn't. even have to finsh the game to know that really don't get it it will make u cry,0
cant even get past first level confusing and stupid a b c d e f g this is more fun then the game singing the Abc's,0

awesome I love it I like pressing fed buttons it is very fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  and you can play it all day and not get board of it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
this game is so adicting and it is relly funny as the button tryst to get you to stop pushing him. you need to by  this game it is so fun :),1
"all you do is press the red butten,and if you don't press the red bitten well....the game is over see what I meek,such a rip off know wonder it was free.",0
on a scale of 1 to 10 it would be a 1.5 it is kind of funny until i reached the part where it made noise i had the sound on full and couldn't hear right for the rest of the day. DO NOT BUY THIS IS STALE.,0
lol this game is great my 3 year old loves it but it says to many bad words.but great game,1
my new favorite thing to do. its hilarious and a great way to spend time. definitely worth downloading if you like senceless humorous,1
this game is so stupid this guy is just telling us stupid stuff this game doesn't even earn a star that's how stupid this game is,0
This app is not amusing and it is really no fun. It stinks! I think it is a really retarded. Nobody I mean nobody should get this app at all. I didn't even want to give it one star,0
"Loosen up, people! This app was meant to be funny and idiotic. So what if it only entertains you for a minute or so? It's great to show friends and to have a little laugh about it!",1
"The only reason this game is so high in ratings is because people see the &quot;do not press&quot; and they just download it , this game is really immature",0
wow I blew up the earth thats for little kids but  it's great on kindle fire I absolutely hate this game.,0
"this app is repetitive and mean. what kind of app says u blew up the world, heven, and hell, I mean really! don't get the evil app, please.",0
I meant to write all that in this onea s d x z w e r f c v ft. a s e e s s ss s s s s s s s s ss s s s s s s s s ss ss s s,1
I saw that most of u said it was good but its not entertaining at all its the most boring. app In the intire. world,0
so all you do is press a stupid button &amp; it insults u? why would u want to get that?!?!?,0
I love this game because it is so hilarious. expecly the ending part. I totally recommend this game for anyone who likes to tick off people.,1
"I don't get the point. nor did I think it was funny, but I don't know why seem people are freakin' out about it. Dumb! Delete!",0
ALL YOU DO IS PRESS A RED BUTTON AND READ THE TEXT THAT IT GIVES YOU. THE STUPID RED BUTTON SAYS THINGS LIKE WHY DONT YOU KILL YOURSELF OR YOUR DEAD AND BECAUSE OF YOU SO IS HEAVEN AND HELL. ITS DUMB THEN THE GAME REPEATS ITSELF SO I DELETED IT IN TWO MI,0
This app works well but it says stuff like &quot;BOOM! You've exploded Heaven and Hell!&quot; &quot; You exploded the earth!&quot; The creators of this game are STUPID!! My Best friends Sister Played this shes only five and she really thought she explode,0
hi I love this game it is soooo a waste of time I just live it. :) thankyou for making this app :) .,1
this game seems really fun to me I can say it is funny to the words the animal says so that's all I have to say good buy.,1
it is fin the sayings are cute and its pretty fun to play it isn't something I would do for 5 hours straight but its free so it was worth the download,1
this is the worst appli ever. who rated this 4 or 5stars? no way. just wasted time. i don't understand why this is the top sales in amazon.,0
This app is basically like reading a short story where you prompt the next page by pressing the red button which the narrator is constantly telling you not to press and making fun of you the whole time.  The product page description is worth checking out,1
i love it!!! it is hilarious!!!! it is super funny and makes me smile and laugh! good to show to friends!!,1
"funny !!!! makes me laugh 90% or the time :) hahahahaha lolz. , and the a elephant it on top.of the button!!!!!!!!!!",1
"It is a good time killer, but it isn't hilarious. You should probably get it. I did. It is okay.",1
its fun but wen it repeat itself its gets boring work with me Its awesome because of the funny words,1
padded reviews for a piece of junk... boo. lets try harder next time.. mmm k? . .  ..  j j,0
"I laughed my butt off while clicking the button. I screamed while laughing, unexpecting a random sound effect. I recommend this to anyone who loves clicking buttons, laughing, being insulted. and ignoring subtitles.",1
A prime example of a waste of bytes. Even kids under age 10 will only get an hour or so's use out of it...,0
"This game seemed sort of ok for the first couple of minutes, I thought that it would be like the moron test but instead it was just rude! It tells you that you are going to die, and blow up the world! Do you really want to play a game like that? Its also",0
this game is sooooooo pointless. But actually a great time waster I finally deleted it cuz I had the conversation memorized! DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!,0
I like do not press red button because it got my in a good mood and its care od funny,1
The button like.. talks to u. It so funny but I wish it said more though. He begs for u to stop pressing the button. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP.,1
"This app is bull poop. Why would someone want BULL POOP?!??! And by the way AppZap, here's  some advice: just because it's free, doesn't mean people will want to buy it. :(",0
I know all of you people give this app low ratings but the app is made to be funny so don't Hate on it. I still don't get how it is number six on the list though,1
"It's not really an app, just a loop of the red button joke, which I find funny personally. Not really something to use all the time, but it's good for a joke now and then.",1
this is the dumbest thing since sliced bread. not funny and now I get to waste more time trying twenty words.  almost done I think,0
"I an not sure what I expected but this was not what I expected. Very clever  fun and people, it is FREE stop complaining... I got more than my moneys worth so to speak",1
"Don't download this lame attempt at humor.  If you think carrot top is funny MAYBE you'll get entertainment out of this, but I seriously doubt it.",0
"Its fun and cute, but I'm not the kind of guy who can keep playing this kind of game. But I got it as a free app, and it was fun once or twice.",1
this game sucks. when I first played this game I almost died so don't play this game buy a free gazer gun for your apps,0
"There is a point . It's an Awesome time killer ( it's everything you want in a app and more).That button in my opinion is awesome , but it's not as eye popping as EVIL ( so thats why i put that in my title ok).",1
"This is the stupidest app ever.  Even for free, it costs too much.  It's like when a four year old says something funny, and people laugh, so said child repeats it a hundred times, ever louder, thinking he can duplicate the reaction over and over.  Yeah.",0
this was the best thing to do very fun and funny did I say how fun this app is to fun for words fun fun fun,1
"This was so much fun! A few capitalization errors but, overall this was very entertaining. I will keep it installed just so my friends can have a good laugh too.",1
"it was absolutely horrible I hated it so much I deleted it, then I hot it again just so I could delete it a second time",0
That was funny! It can keep an idiot busy for a very extremely long time! Lol! What fun this game,1
Do you think hell is a good thing to say to kids think you teens it is nothing ti you but to kids it is a knew word and bad word if you are 8 or under don't get it it is just dumb and if you think bad words are cool the are not.,0
I absolutely love this app it is sooo funny and its free so you should get it its perfect for when your bord!! get it!!,1
It is very funny and time consuming to read and play with this little red button but I loved it.,1
"this game is so very funny. actullay its more hilarious. I mean there is this crazy, grumpy and fun narrator who gives u these fun quizzes that if u play all of them last up to like twenty full minutes. I mean if ur waiting to get something u can just pl",1
"the app is very entertaining. it is so funny. I hope this person can make a don't press the green button,blue button, green button, pink button, and so on. download it",1
It keeps telling you to commit suicide and that your mom will hate you! I finally deleted the app after it told me I was dead about 20 times.I found that this was the worst game ever!,0
please let me have it. It is so cool and I love it. It is taunting me to get it.,1
to me it is hilarious. that he keeps telling me not to press it and then it makes that little explosive sound. its pretty good it use the h word but its still funny.,1
ok it sours fun but no. it just keep telling you dont press the red bottom.then after time it says your dead. then the voice says it is going to sleep. then it starts over.,0
"REALLY FUNNY app. Do not press the big red button. If you do, just find out what will happen. You know you wanna. Do it.",1
this is a everyday thing the first time u play it its so FUNNY fun fun fun fun fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUN,1
this app is not what I thought it was.  It's stupid and not even funny.  worst app I've ever purchased even if it was for free....,0
I thought it was really funny. It made me laugh a lot. I recommend this app to people who like pushing buttons and laughing. This app may be really stupid to you or you may like it. Give it a try.,1
"When I need to keep someone occupied for a few minutes, this is a great one.  I hand them my Kindle, and when I come back, the person is always still there, pressing buttons, with a silly grin on his/her face, and occasionally laughing out loud..  So muc",1
It is really fun to press the button and annoy the the text more. This is super hilarious!!Made me laugh like crazy !!!!!!!!!!,1
This game is so addicting! I've had my whole familly play it. I love the ones where it turd into like a million little red buttons. Oh yeah and the other one when it turns into an elephant,1
was curious to what this was since none of the reviews were specific.  you try to hit the button and different phrases pop up while the button moves around the screen telling u to not hit the button. glad it was free and that it only wasted my time.,0
"gees peoples, this is meant as a joke. and if you are mad at it fir saying hell then loosen up. I grew up with my family saying that word and even worse stuff. this game is fun.me gusta queso",1
watch tophatvideos on youtube and you will get 500x the amusement of this game...this game is amusing and makes u laugh...although it has no end it is fun. but wen it talks about the white button don't waste ur time looking 4 it because u wont find it.,1
"This app is fun and is meant to be a joke. If you guys don't like it,  then you must not get the joke. Take a joke people. I played this app several times and still found it fun. I would recommend it, if you have a sense of humor",1
"The only problem with this app is there is no music. Live this app, but my boss doesn&apos;t. I got put on a probation period cause I was using this at work and not helping customers. Wth? I love my evo 4g, leave me alone. :-)",1
Omg its sooo funny it gets me every time I LOVE IT. whoever say a bad review if u don't like u soooo much then y do u even put a review about it personally if I were u I wouldn't write one anyways seriously this game is soooo awesomeBTW: if u put any rat,1
This app is fun but as you get towards the end it starts to insult you and tells you to go to the place under everything! NEVER GET THIS APP,0
I pressed every single button on the one that had like one hundred red buttons and it dident approve.so that is why.,0
Human nature...you have to press the button cause you are told not to. Then you keep pressing to see the next message and you keep getting told.to stop.Its amusing. I wish it would change ideas though rather than looping. Worth getting for nothing and sh,1
"ok this app is meant to be stupid, thats the novelty of it. i love the dialouge of the guy, whoever it is. i could play this all day...",1
"This app is awesome, and I love to trick my friends with it. The red button is a story on an endless loop. I love the hilarious commentary from the button. Great :-)",1
"Yes, get this app!  It does NOT tell you to go to hell but in fact is a halarious way to pass time. The first time I played it, I laughed so hard I cried! :D",1
l wish this game never came out becquerel it is the stupidest game in the world it should get zero stars because it is not even funny,0
I hats this app. when it told me to commit suicide I was really mad. suicide isn't to joke about.,0
the app was funny for me but I don't think kids 9 and under should play it it says rude things and says bad words it also says things that slung kind of evil.,0
"This was soo much fun, but it does say a cuss word 3 times. So I wouldn't recommend it to small children.",1
why does everyone hate this app it does what it says it will j j j j j j j Nb j j bb j,1
I liked this tame very much. was a lot of fun. I especially like the part when he says that hes not dead hes just text.,1
don't get this app it just said don't press it again.now is that stupid or what?stupid right. I hate it so much,0
"This is soooo funny!!!!  I love it &gt;&lt;  Its plain funny, and I went through it with my brother and he was laughing so hard and so was I. XDDDDD",1
really your not gonna go to hell and the world did not exploed and there is no white dot so the dot is lying and I do think its funny but I don't laugh,1
yes some jerks would say its stupid but no its not stupid! in my opinion its a brain twister. excellent for younger children. I'm 100% sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-Madyson A. Cooper,1
TO ALL PEOPLE:if u r reading this comment very soon the only red button u will be pressing is the DISTROY THIS APP FOREVER button!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
I don't know why everyone says it is so stupid. it is actually really funny. I laugh every time. it is so hilarious. I love ot. it makes me and my friends occupied and it keeps us lathing for hours and hours.,1
"this is so funny! I loved and it still keeps me laughing! if you need a good laugh, download this app!",1
its hilarious..... the text is so mean but who cares its funnier....  lol........ I play jokes on mi frnds wit it..... they gt seo mad,1
I just don't understand how to make this work.  It's very confusing. This is just what I have done review,0
its a good game its really funny it is the best game ever I am glad he or she made itI like the way it starts over do not press the red button,1
I wouldn't waste your time on this app. it is very repetitive and get old way to fast. I wasted about a half hour of my life pressing a stupid ditgital button.,0
its fun for a bit.  the secret to it is to go through it 20 times.  when you do that there is a cool end with a link to a website.  its actually worth the time to do it.  good luck and have fun.,1
"Best app. Fun, funny and entertaining. Best it is free so you can&apos;t complain about anything. Just dune random weiss fit the reentry bring mfg mfg jfk ideal posh bck buck lcm",1
GggggggggggggggRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrEeeeeeeeeeeeeTtttttttttt tame fun and Dumb. oveal silly talking button game would pay 1doller /inmature but fumnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.  must buy oh wait FREE,1
"this is truly a dumb app. all u do is repeatedly press a button while being insulted and told to go to h***. I cant even think of why somebody would want this. basically, it is only fun for people who enjoy being made fun of repeatedly. that is all this ",0

it is really tempting to press a red button any day so on this app you can press it without blowing something up or causing ww3,1
"So, I downloaded it because my cousin wanted to check it out. I admit, it entertained the both of us for about 20 seconds. This is not a game, it's a poorly made button made for purely entertainment reasons...there is no storyline or levels that you have",0
extremely boring and repetative. thats the first words.that come to mind. and i have to say this is the worst app i have yet downloaded. that is DEFINITLEY saying somthing,0
What is the big deal about this app? This app is so stupid! I do not think the swear words or any other abusive language does threaten me. What's so fun about this app! You just press a red button the whole time!!!! Sure what the red button says is funny,0
Well that was pretty dumb if you ask me. What was the point? You just keep hitting the button. Wow,0
this app is great! so funny! it just keeps going. I showed my friend &amp; sheloved it too!******** is what I rate it!,1
all u do is press the bitten and it says words not fun bet there is a better app so don't get this app it is so not worth it,0
This game is horrible. All you do is press a button. Then it says something. I don't like this game.,0
it is awesome and I cant whait to play this game and I'm going to press the red annd I want to see what will happen when I press the red button,1
well when I first tried it I knew withought a doubt it was going to be a silly and funny app! : ),1
"This is not for anyone who likes fun. I mean seriously, come on, AppZap. this would be better if the thing had more of an exciting responce. It is so repetitive, it's not even funny. Oh, wait, it is. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!",0
I loved this on the computer and now I can take it with me on my Galaxy Tab! obviously this is not a game. it&apos;s just a joke type thing to amuse you or your friends.,1
this game is so stupid. all you do is press the red butten and then it says not to press the red bitten.so don't get this game.,0
"Gosh, i thought that when i opened the app, i would not press it. I waited, &amp; waited but nothing happened. I thought if i pressed it, something terrible would happen.I did. Want to know what happened?  Well find out for yourself.",1
"Very entertaining but as said before it is sort of a one time app. You get it, you laugh at it show to a friend and then delete it. but it is really really funny and I reccomend it to anyone who wants a good laugh",1
all I have to say is it just starts over again there is no end don't get it waste of time,0
"for all those people who says it tells you to go to hell, and to commit scuicide,  cant take a joke. all it says is that your in a layer of hell. but you explode hell,  and that's good. I still like this app. for anyone who has a sense of humor, this is ",1

this app is hilarious!once u start u cant stop! p.s. don't waste ur time finding the white button. there isn't one,1
"so I just went on tapping this then at the end it said _____________________________________________, lmfao it wad so funny! its worth getting it for fun and entertainment",1
"great for those of us who just HAVE TO PUSH  THE BUTTON. but after a minutes, just got boring, ehh",1
"This is not a game. you wont win anything. Some may find this entertaining, but i felt offended at theresponses this &quot;game &quot; was programed to give. Not for kids either!",0
I loved all the negative reviews after pressing the button. The instructions said DO NOT PRESS but you went and did it anyways. Great for a laugh especially getting the elephant.,1
This game says swar words and it says i hate you...you suck(ect). IM TELLING YOU DO NOT GET THIS STUPID APP!! The game os really boring i agree that this app should no longer be existing. The people who say that this is fun well they are very very wrong.,0
It's very entertaining! And it's also fun to watch somebody else play it and see their reaction ( my mom ). It's so worth it. :),1
This is the most pointless game on earth. It`s not even a game.... anybody who likes this game is a complete moron.,0

A lot of people say that this game is pointless but who cares? its funny and very entertaining. luv sharing it with my friends!,1
But it's not really worth the time and effort to download. I even feel like I am wasting my time reviewing this.,0
"it says not to press it, but you have to, it taunts you and teases you all the way through. just when you actually fear for your life, it's over. whew",1

"Don't Get This. Plz Plz Plz Plz. Don't Get This. My Friends and me Have this game, its Boring.(Warning May Cause Boredom). I don't like this. I like Brussel Sprouts more then this.",0
My kids downloading this and they absolutely love it.  They are always playing this game and like the graphics on it.,1
"This ""game"", while ridiculous, is still fun. I can't imagine playing it often, but it' something to do when you have nothing else to do, or just need to smile. Also fun to have someone else play in front of you or to leave it sitting around where someone",1
i got the game cuase my friend said it was pretty funny. like a crazy person i bought the &quot;update&quot; which just changed probably one phrase.  then i went through it again but it could as a matter a fact make a drunk sober enough to delete it.,0

"This app ensures days of fun and creativity. If I had to rate this game from 1 to 10 on addictiveness, this would easily get a 128,901,428. The developers did an excellent job of recreating an excellent real life hobby of many men and women and maybe enh",1
"Unless you have the time and patience, don't get this app. Its not like the Moron test like I thought it was. You just keep hitting the button and quotes come up saying &quot;do not hit the button.&quot; I say, &quot;Do not get.&quot;",0
"Not sure that I expected any better, but this is a complete waste of time.  Hopefully nobody made any money on this.",0
this app is cool on on one of the parts aka when the world blows up it makes a boom sound and I got the app when I was in my bed in the dark and I had it on full volume it scared me so bad. I recommend u get this appif u want to laught,1
"ur just hitting a stupid button in a box.plus, it takes 10 minutes to do the whole thing if u read the text. then, I got to the end and it didn't even blow up or anything... it just repeats the whole freaking thing(sorry for spoiling it -_- )",0

"This game is a rip-off!!!!! All you do is press a stupid button and read what they it thinks. I thought it would be fun, but it wasted my time. Don't buy this app, it must of been created by lameos!",0

works very well on my kindle fire and it is extremely entertaining!! it is definetely worth getting!! its funny too :-) :-),1
"I think this is a really great app. There's a saying that says &quot;rules are meant to be broken&quot; If you don't go by this saying for this app, you'll be sitting with this device in your hand for however long your life is. (Or until you figure out y",1
"Not an app to keep, but funny for a download. Kills some time and somewhat amusing. Well made at the least!",1
"Ha! Funny, and for everyone saying &quot;this person had too much time on their hands&quot; and you don&apos;t? You&apos;re rating a &quot;Don&apos;t touch the red button app!&quot; We laughed, then uninstalled... Lolz",1
"This game is horrible! All you do is push a red button (even though it tells you not to) and it gets smaller. Then, as if to make the game worse, there gets to be more of them! You can't complain that its free, though.",0
this game is amusing and fun but I did not know it had a bad word in it. but other than that I love this game the button teases you.  PUSH THE BUTTON,1
I would not buy this again ... it had no point to the game ... maybe it was just me,0
I do not recommend this button that's it a button press the button and read that's it!! it go's on&infin;and beyond,0

Funny. Clever. Worth the price (free). Can't get laughs any cheaper than this. Did I mention it was unique? Play it.,1
very stupid. it has no point. u hit a red button. the red button does nothing. its pointless. I would not get this app. Ever.,0
"Im not saying it's not funny, but it gets really boring. after you go through it once, the jokes get repetitive and i uninstalled it. not recommended.",0
"I like it. All you people offended by this app, jeez. As someone said earlier, it's meant for people with a sense of humor. Besides, it said DON'T PRESS THE RED BUTTON. Your fault.",1
"I still don't see why there's only one gun, the Desert Eagle. I mean its ok, but there has to be more variation between the choice of guns...",0
Well I thought this would have more to it than what I got. Anything to sell. People will try it.,0
this app is not good it only has one choice for a gun and the gun sounds fake and it doesnt even jerk back as if it has kick don't reccemond,0

Will not install on LG Optimus! I tried a couple times it just resets my phone. Saw another review about the optimus but figured I'd try no good.,0
I could not get this to work very well on my phone.  It had a very hard time registering swipes (Galaxy S) making it impossible to beat even just the first round of play.,0
a nice idea but the problem is that when u try to tap the monsters they dont always move so u lose the alotted time the game gives u.,0
it is a fun game and deserves at least a 3 from all............i will recommend itGame is HD and controls are fine on my tablet.,1
I'm giving this five stars just because the dev didn't review his or her own app. it has been a nasty trend recently.,1
"Agree with the other reviewers - unresponsive controls, couldn't seem to track my swipes, and as far as I could tell no SD support.  Uninstalled.",0
This game is frustrating and the controls are slow and unresponsive. This should be removed until the developer redevelop the game. HTC sensation,0
Graphics are nice. Works real well on my HTC Thunderbolt. Good overall game. Should be 99&cent; when not free though.,1

"This might be fine if this is the type of Sodoku you are looking for, but it wasn't for me.  I only rated it low for that reason.",0
This sudoku app is very easy to use. I love playing it on my Kindle. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to play Sudoku as its got several levels to choose from,1
Just don't like it. better games available. prefer Sudoku's that won't put the wrong # in the space. don't like it.,0

"Ads and more ads. The animals did nothing when you touched the screen. Even the smallest grandkids were NOT entertained, but were more annoyed than anything.",0
I thought you could interact with the anamals but it only makes 1 sound every minute. I think you shouldn't get this app. It was a huge disappoint.,0
who would waste their time stroking fake pets.its a waste of time.you could do much better things with your time.DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!,0
this game is crap I thought it would be like fish adventure or birdland but no it sucks don't purchase it.it sucks believe me,0
I thought that it would be ok even though everyone else said it sucked but it really does suck I couldn't even make the animals do anything not even make a noise!!! I recommend you don't get it!!!,0
it only gives you a picture of a bear and you pet the bear it does not do any thing.Its just a dumb picture.,0
I love puppies so when I found this game I was so happy to see that they had my kinds of pets,1
"This app is dumb. Its stupid. only shows pictures of ten animals.I would only recommend it for kindle owners with 2 year old kids, NOT adult or teenage people.",0
I have a cat that is much more fun to pet than this app. stupid stupid STUPID! don't download. I'M WARNING YOU! READ THE REVIEW! DOWNLOAD AND YOU SHALL BE CURSED! BWAHHAHAHAHAHA!,0
Jeez you have to agree to something of course I didn't read it cuz I'm lazy but still it came harm your divice.I don't think this is the best app.,0
what the f*** is this for nobody will like it not even baby's like u stare at cute pics. while like they make a sound oh wow big deal,0
it is so stupid all their is is pictures and words and it doesn't even make any sound. it is the worst game ever! I hate it. you cant even pet the animal.,0
my daughter was sad. nothing to do at all. we erased it in 10 seconds. what a shame...could of beenfun,0

this is the worst game in the world. navery get this game because you will reaget it .bealve me I now.,0
"okay,im not quite sure what to do with this app,i got it for my brother, but when you touch the animals nothing happens, not even a noise,so im confused.",0
it's a nice game but i think it would be better on a tablet. with the screen size on my og droid it makes it hard to drive the fish around.,1
The controls are just fine and this is a fun game for a while.  The adventure mode can be beat in an hour or two but it is certainly worth downloading.,1
"I got this app not exactly knowing what it was but became quite addicted to it, and its as simple as it sounds grow your fish!!, it's a simple game but still maintains a good level of challangehd2- android",1
I have been waiting so long for a game like this. Survival of the fittest. Eat anything smaller than you. Get eaten by bigger creatures. Grow! Eat the bigger guys who messed with you before. It's a simple and fun concept. Spore uses it. Darwin's island m,1
"A great time passer.  Haven't been playing it long, but - so far - it is a cute game. Try it",1
"This is very similar to a Popcap game I really enjoyed on the PC, Feeding Frenzy. The more little fish you eat, the bigger you get. The bigger you get, the bigger fish you can eat.",1
"Great game seems dull at first, but gets better. Lots of levels with a shop to purchase upgrades. This game seems stupid at first because of the levels where they teach you how to play. Hang in there and you'll like it!",1
"Graphics are ok, sounds are ok.  But game was too simple so I stopped playing after just a few minutes.  When I closed the game, the sounds continued to play.  Started game again and used task manager to kill it.  Game closed, but sounds continued still.",0
"Great adventure game. It's awesome, fun, and time-eating. I recommend this game for anyone looking for something that requires good strategy or that has a slight challenge to it while not being too difficult. Overall I love it and would pay up to $7 for ",1
"I don't like 'endless' type games so I'm very glad this has levels. The menu is slightly pixelated and cheap looking, but the game is excellent. Cute and colorful,good sounds and nice controls. I prefer the joystick control but it's nice to have a choice",1
I downloaded this as the FAOTD and it reminded me of a game called Osmosis I got as the FAOTD as well.  I loved that game and the fish game was quite similar but a little easier to understand since it was easy to tell bad fish rather than bad cells.,1
"Fun game, many levels and two different difficulties. Its addictive, I have beat the game once and am going back to play them all on Advanced.",1
"The &quot;most helpful reviews&quot; for this game are not helpful at all. If you read only that, you will never give a chance to the this little lovely game. It is a very good game , similar to the famous game named &quot;Helium&quot;, which I uninstall",1
While the game itself is fun and cute. Most of it is used to save money and then build up your self confidence to play survival mode. And endlessly fun throw your phone at the wall and play it again kind of fun.,1
"Games like this have been around for a long time and, having played several versions myself, I find the effort and quality of this game rather lacking. There are many free games like this online that are much more fun.",0
The goal is to eat fish smaller than yourself without being eaten along the way.  A very cute game that gradually increases in difficulty.  My 4 year old enjoys playing the easier levels and I like the more challenging ones.  I like how you can upgrade y,1
"Ad free?  Meh- not really .. never mind that you really can't even play this game without buying add ons. I get the premise of selling more powers in games, everyone has to make a buck but this game equates to nothing except swimming a fish around to eat",0
"Got this game and can't stop playing.  Fun fun fun, beat part is competing for the highest score in the online leader board.",1
Had to delete it due to its lameness. Could possibly be fun for others who don't find simple things entertaining.,0
"This is game is simple to understand and does not need a long tutorial to figure out. Its best aspect is the desire for improvement, meaning the player always wants a bigger and faster fish. The game has an variety of powerups the player can use to catch",1
simple fun power ups perfect graphics enjoyable gameplay for a good game it'll take half your battery and that's after 10 levels. happy fun.,1
Have not heard of this & don't recall downloading.Did you know Amazon does this bait & switch sort of think with the discounts for applying for an Amazon card?,0
This game kept me occupied for a long time. Wish there were more levels.Great game which advances through levels with a chance to set your personal performance.,1
"This game is fun, esp when bored and you don't want to think too much. I enjoy the different fish you have to conquer or run from.",1
I was all set to hate this game based on other user reviews and when i played it... i found it fun and entertaining. I dislike joystick games so having to tilt my kindle fire isn't a problem for me like for other users. You eat other fish and earn coins ,1
holy crap what a terrible game. talk about trying to ride the coattails of angry birds. the leveling system is a rip off of birds. and this game is so boring.,0
"While I didn't pay for the app, I got it via Blackmart/4shared, it was a great game. The adventure mode provides a real challenge, with great replay value. definitely a must!",1

Great game. I enjoyed it a lot. nice concept. I wonder why the same apps/games that have 4.5 - 5 rating in Android market (which they deserve) always have 2-3 rating in the Amazon market.,1

Figuring out the solution to each level is very fun. The objective and scoring are very straight forward (unlike Angry Birds) which means striving for a perfect score each level is actually enjoyable and skill-based not luck-based.,1

"I find this app very useful.  The set-up has many category selections, within that, there are units, and then value.  I didn't know there is a difference in a US cup and a metric cup - I thought a cup was a cup!  So, not only do I get the information I t",1

This app let's you convert between different measurement systems quickly and easily. It's very handy for carpentry and mechanical work.,1

Kindle Fire User:  I am so glad that I stopped trying to get the Flightview app to work and got the American Airlines app instead. I have access to my entire account right there so I can be assured that the information is the most current and is correct.,1
I find this very handy as I use a AA vard and travel as much as I can with AA . They call with update the day you are flying so that help to arrange the proper time to travel time to airports.,1
Due to weather several of my flights were delayed and the AA program was easy to access and get my updated information.  It also gave me connecting gate information before I even got off the first plane to the connecting flight.  Very helpful!,1
allows us to check on the flights that we are taking with AA and be sent notifications of their departure. Can check in on the phone...we will see how well this works when we are in St Maarten,1

Gives me more flexibility when sitting in an airport which is all too frequent these days. Now we need an App for reserving overhead bin space.,1

This is perfect.  Beats waiting outside an airport for a plane that has been delayed because of weather or some other reason.,1

i dont even remember using this i deleted it so fast it must have been totally worthless. but it was free so try yourself,0

Must have app if you or a love one do a lot of flying or going on trips and then some.,1
"As a former private pilot, I found this progarm outstanding.  It provides me with more then necessary information I need to plan my flight.  I highly recommend this program.  One need not be a pilot to use this.",1
Super tool to track flights. Works on domestic and international flights. If you call the airport they will give you minimum info. With this app. you will know where the. Flight is and you can plan your pick up better. For me a definate keeper.,1
Have you ever wondered just where in their flight your loved one was when flying to a destination?  This is an easy to use app that shows exactly the place in the sky the plane is traveling.  Times are given so you can judge when to leave for the airport,1
Love to use this to tack flights anytime anywhere. Even if you don't know the flight number or even airlines you can find a flight you are looking for.,1

I was recently traveling in bad weather so my flight times were constantly being changed.  This app let me see the changes before we were ever notified by the airline.,1
Great resource and very easy to use.Good app and would recommend other flyers add it to their electronic resources.,1
Boy is this a handy app to track flights.  Really easy to use - love the map interface - strongly recommended to anybody who ever picks up anybody at the airport!,1
Whenever people fly out to see us I can track their flight all the way across the world. The nicest thing is you know whether there going to arrive early or late. Saves a lot of waiting time at the airport.,1
No more wondering if the flight has arrived while waiting in the cellphone lot. It lets you know in real time. A very useful app if you fly a lot or offer to pick up friends and family at the airport. Used to have to hunt for this info on my laptop at ho,1
"This app is quick and easy to find a flight, see the stats on the flight and where the plane is at the moment.",1

"Since the loss of Google Reader I was at a loss and a gathering point for my news feed. The was a little battle of readers for a while but I'm glad I found feedly the interface is almost identical on all of my devices; iPhone 5, kindle fire, iMac and Mac",1
My only complaint isn't really a complaint. I wish I could open more than one post at a time. Otherwise it's a near perfect app.,1
"Freely is absolutely the easiest way to access the many differing blogs I follow.  On my kindle, access is simple and fast.  I can organize the blogs by subject to maintain coherency.",1
I had previously used Google reader and this is similar. It's easy to find blogs you want to follow in the search bar and add them to different categories. You can change the settings to customize it to your liking. The app itself is very professional lo,1
I was upset after Google shut down Reader. I had read some good reviews on Feedly but saw some negatives saying it didn't sync with Feedly Cloud on the Fire version. I guess that was in the past because it works great now. I love that it syncs to my phon,1
"RSS feeds changed the way I used the internet 5-6 years ago and gave me a lot of my time back.  I am a Kindle loyalist and was looking for a good RSS reader.  I found Feedly and couldn't be happier.  It is perfect and does wverything I need it, too.  I c",1
I used to use Feedly before Google acquired it but now in order to use the app it mandates signing in with a Google account.  I don't want to use Google and I can't save feeds I want to read locally on my phone so this is a useless app.,0
"Unless 1 of 2 things are true:youve paid for something else or have an irrational nostagic attachment to another podcast collector.  Great app, aggregates my podcasts in a coherent manner, and cut over from google reader was effortless.",1
I love it...This is a great app for a person that likes to keep up with the latest news..Download it on kindle fire it works smooth,1
Really love this app. It makes it really easy to see all the blogs I like to follow without having to go to my email and check them individually. I can quickly scroll through and see what I want to read more of or what I don't.,1
If you used Google reader and were sad to see it go than this app is the answer for you.,1
"At the risk of sounding too dorky, this app is an essential for me. It only shows me links that I point it to and NO ADS. There is really nothing left to say, absolutely no down sides. I love it.",1
I love that i can skim headlines and a blurb from various stories from various news sources all in one place. It also lets me know which are read or unread. Very convenient love it!,1
"Feedly has become the most-used app on my Kindle Fire. Nice, clean, modern interface for perusing news feeds. Love the swipe-based controls. Very nicely done.",1
I really like Feedly as a replacement for Reader.  It is easy to sort through all my craft blogs and orgsnize then.  I like the thumbnail style main page also.,1
I think the feedly app is far superior to the UI of the web version. I LOVE the swipe method of marking things as read or unread. This makes it so easy to follow all my newsfeeds.,1
This reader is SO much better than Google's - Try it - you won't ever look for another RSS reader again.,1
Just glad you were here when Google decided to split.. I have used this before Google disappeared and enjoy the layout. Works well on my Kindle Fire HD.,1
I was sad to learn Google was ending Reader. I did what several million other Reader users did and easily transferred my subscriptions to Feedly. So far I'm satisfied with the switch.,1
"I had Feedly before. Didn't like it, so I removed it from my Kindle. But after repeated difficulties seeing Blogs I Follow on my Blogger dashboard, I decided to give Feedly another shot. I'm so glad I did.",1
A real nice reader that is available on a wide variety of device s. Very fast and easy-to-use.  Works quite well on the kindle no glitches. Built in browser works excellent and is easy and intuitive to use.,1
"Ever since Google reader was shut down I have looked for a substitute for it. After trying many Feed Readers, I have settled on this as my replacement.",1
"This app is always crashing on a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It's it the Kindle? Is it the app? I don't know, but considering how frequently it happens, I'm inclined to believe the latter. As it is, it's almost unusable.",0
I was not familiar with RSS feeds until today. That's that little orange logo that looks like a wi-fi symbol that you see on just about every web page thats important to you. Feedly is beautiful and user friendly. Displays nice windows that slide up/down,1
Better than Google Reader. It's able to present news in a much better format. Feedly also organizes the articles better.,1
Cannot log into Google account from the latest Kindle Fire. Waste of time downloading this app. Disappointing to say the least.,0
"Works in Chrome, Android, and Kindle. Feedly will replace the syncing back end when Google kills Reader in a few months. +1",1
"This feed reader is very fast and has a clean appearence.It looks like your running Windows 8.  It is very easy to customize and gives you the option to tweet, post on Facebook, or email an article.  You can even set up an email list.  After reading an a",1
"I have been using this service ever since google reader was retired. It took a little while, but I have gotten used to the interface and other unique features. This is definitely the best app/website combo I have seen for reading res feeds.",1
"Works well, stable and fast. Easy to use. The only complaint is it will not let me paste an address in the add content area to add a feed like I can in a web browser.",1
"I've tried all the major players - Google reader, pulse, netvibes, pageflakes, taptu, easy rss, etc.  In my opinion, Feedly is by far the best news aggregator. It's also one of the only ones that works on your phone, tablet, AND the desktop.",1
"There are a number of blogs I like to check on regularly, but since I am often doing so from my Fire or my Smart Phone, rather than my desktop, it is great to have the Feedly app available in all three places so that I can check in whenever I have a few ",1
Organization is great.Easy to add blogs to your feed.Keeps all recent posts upfront.No issues linking to the actual site.Great replacement for Google Reader.,1
"I switched to feedly from Google reader because it was being discontinued. Best thing to happen! I love feedly, and this app allows me to check a all of the blogs I follow easily on my Kindle Fire.",1
This app works and looks amazing on the HP Touchpad.  Looks perfect and utilizes the HD screen of a HP Touchpad.  Great Job.  All my Google Reader content in a beautiful layout.  Also plays video and podcast within the app.,1
"Only what I want, not what someone else thinks I want.I dumped newshog after they added annoying ads, and so glad, feedly is superior.",1
"A recommended replacement for Google Reader. It has always worked perfectly for me on my Kindle Fire. Easy to organize, so if you are organized, you can find what you're looking for with not much effort.",1
I love Feedly. It's the first thing I open on my Kindle to catch all the current headlines and decide which ones I want to go deeper into!,1
"Have used this  before and I love it . They made my transition from Google easy and seamless, loads up and opens so you can enjoy. Thanks bill",1
"I've been a loyal user of Google Reader until it was retired. And soon after, I've become so used to Feedly that it has become my new RSS reader.",1
Had to get a replacement for google reader because good had the nerve to close reader down. I moved over to feedly and it made the loss much less painful. the only suggestion is I miss searching through just my feeds,1
"I found this as a suggestion to replace Google Reader, and I wish I knew aboit it sooner. It is a fantastic RSS Reader with great features and enough flash to it to make it look slick without overdoing it. I like that it syncs accross all devices so when",1
I never got to see what it was about. I tried to dl the app but a message came back as corrupt.if they fix the problem I'll be happy to try downloading again.,0
"This app sucks. It is very inaccurate, and it only tests you on recognizing patterns. I wasn't expecting much, but this was worse than expected.",0
I have no idea how it really compares to other IQ Tests of any kind. I took my test at 11:30pm on my new Kindle Fire HD and surprised myself.  May take it again when I am bright eyed and more awake.  Really read or review each test item.  Think beforeyou,1
This did not test intelligence.  It is basically a math test for spatial problems.  A true IQ test tests for all ranges of knowledge.  Glad I didn't have to pay for this one.,0
"I took the test and I was not happy with my score so I tried again and I came up!  So I wanted to test my family and one by one we all score about the same. Until my son with adhd played, he scored higher than us all. Well can you imagine what that did f",1
"It doesn't even have a valid way of testing your knowledge. It only tests on math and language arts, not even science. It is mostly questions such at &quot;what comes next in the pattern.&quot; If you aren't good with those like me, it will grade you ver",0
"Can not zoom, hard to read, too small letters and graphics on the 7&#34; fire. I do not know if they are more readable on larger tablets, but it was not fun with the 7&#34; fire.Dump it.",0
"Especially since I am exhausted and haven't been using my analytical thinking skills lately.  It's a lower score than I got the last time I took an official IQ test, but that was many years ago. The questions are what I would have expected, and I don't s",1
"I thought that this would be a mindless test, like a stupidity test but it actually requires a pen and paper to do some of the math problems I deleted it right away",0
"I am so relieved to find out that I have a mind and it is actually working!  Seriously, this is a fun way to find out if your brain is atrophied after being retired!",1
"Decent enough app that is exactly what it says it is, an iq test. I can't speak for how accurate it is but I had no problems at all downloading or using it on a 2nd gen kindle fire. My main reason for writing this review was to try to (at least to a smal",1
this is amazing. it tests my IQ and I'm going to meed that. any way this is great for all ages. from 4 or 5 and up untill it dies. well you know what I mean. this is a smart app and should be more that free. its so good I think teachers could use it to t,1
Great tool to sit back and keep your mind connected with hands and eyes. This is one of my favorites.,1

this app talks about sexual stuff and o gave it to my son and he asked me what is s3x? so this app Is so inoproprite not for children under 16,0
hellooooo i havent even got this yet but i usally look at reviews before i get them and who ever made this game is sick and gross and this is NOT aceptable. i voted this app a one star because u cant vote no stars. bad. very bad. super bad.,0
"Both truths and dares are for people at least age eighteen. This is not a family game, and the questions are actually related to things that can be offensive as well. Questions are repetitive.",0

Thought this game would be fun to do with the grandchildren...NOPE...is an ADULT game.  I am still trying to get it deleted. Even as an adult...I found it offensive.,0

I hate it haves bad words and I'm 10 didn't get it. it has one thing it says to have sex with a player.,0
This is a lot of fun. It comes with preset truths and dares. You can also add truths and dares. You get to pick truth or dare. Its a lot of fun when you have a group of people.,1
So my friend came over and she said hi. Anyhow I was looking 4 a truth if dare app. Then I found this piece of bS it was full of dirty stuff like beer and sex. This game is some  serious cheddar. DO NOT GET! NOT WORTHY IF ONE STAR! EWWW!And my friend als,0

"I am a young woman.and I wanted a fun game to play with friends. Not something gross. This asks you all these privet inaproperate things. If your young and want a good Truth and Dare, skip THIS! Unliss you want to talk about girlfriend / boyfriend. stuff",0
I was looking at this app.. I looked at the second picture and I knew my mom would've flopped.. badly .. omg I was grosser out! I would've been grounded for a User thts how bad this is..,0
I got this game because I thought this one looked more like a truth or dare for KIDS... I should had looked at the reviews! this game is gross! not a game kids should play. think before you buy.........THINK!!!,0
"this app is very innapropriate and invasive! &quot;do you wear thongs&quot;? what's the wierdest place you have had s*x&quot;? have u ever had an orgasm? very innapropriate, and even if you delete all of them and put in ur own, its still not that great!!",0
So weird. It has stuff like: Do you wear a thong?That's gross and discusting! I should not even rate his any stars. Please! Don't buy.,0
"Who would have guessed Kindle Fire has no option for cleaning your contact list easily!?! I thought I was going to have to clean my close to 1,000 entry contact list one item at a time. This was such a huge help to me. In just minutes my contact list was",1

"Easy to use and did exactly what I needed,  Even though I may only need it once, I'm not getting rid of it because I might need it again someday.",1
so this thin was a waste of time and download...uselessdeleted it soon as I saw how it works..meaning it doesnt work for people with google contacts.,0
Not only does it deliver as promised but it has one of the best looking font faces on an app you'll ever visualize. To bad you'll only see it for a few seconds tops as the app does its thing in flick of a moment.  Instructions noting the exception where ,1
"This is a really nice game with a good bonus. The bonus round comes up pretty often. The first time i played this game, I got the bonus round over 10 times and my balance was over $900,000. If only it was real money. I wish!!!",1
the buck is well worth it easy to use graphics are ok. this is the one and only slot machine app i use regularly pokie magic definitely struck gold on this app i repeat get this app you will love it,1

"Game and graphics are really nice on my Kindle Fire. Again, if you like slot games you won't be sorry if you get this one. The payout is good so it makes the game fun.",1
I love this game.  It is one of my favorites.  I have recommended it to several of my friend .  They like it.,1
Good game.  Graphics are beautiful and it's fun to play.  Easy to get lots of points.  Always mute the sound so don't know how that is.,1
Great game. Best part is they do not rip you off having to actually buy coins.  No problems at all on my kindle.,1
Really like the Pokie Magic games. It's a lot of fun. This game is very colorful and changes when things could get boring.,1
"Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  My family and I play is whenever we can.  Everything about this game is fun, and it was free!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes slot machines. The sounds, music and visuals are great.  Glad I went for it.",1
This game is really cool and the fire breathing dragon is pretty awesome and the payouts are the BEST and I like the bonus games,1
Downloaded to my Fire Kindle and worth the $0.99 cents. Played other Slots but this one is the best. Sounds &amp; Graphics are good.,1
"In real casinos, one of my favorite slot machines is the Fire Dragon.  This game put out by Pokie Magic simulates the real thing!  I have fun playing it at night in bed, always trying to get the bonus before I turn off the light.  Knowing that I've made ",1
"PROS:  Well worth the 99 cents for the hours of fun it has given me.  There are no pop-up ads asking you to buy something else, like there are in most of the free games, that alone makes it worth the 99 cents.  It pays out very frequently.  In the game o",1
I have been playing this game for a long time now and I enjoy it.  It is always fun to play and see what will happen. I started playing this game on my I-touch  and I now have it on my kindle .,1
"This cracked screen prank is pretty realistic. It has a lot of choices for what kind of crack you want, and the size of the crack. It's easy to use, and you can even use other apps while the crack is still on the screen. Very satisfying, good job!",1
i loved it because it totally scared my sister cuz she actually thought i broke it lol :) u should get it also,1

I like this app. 9/9 modes totally creeped out my mom.The cracks look real and you can control the size and stuff.,1
This prank works better than I actually expected it to. I try to remember to set it whenever someone asks to borrow my phone or if I have to show someone something on it. The look on their face is priceless!,1

I would give this app 0 stars if I could but apparently that is not an option.  so if you read this don't waste your time with this app.,0
there is an app for iPod touches and smartphones called juicy fruit sweet talk and it shows similar things. but the mouths say funny things instead of blowing raspberries. this stinks for kindle fire. its cheesy and looks like a bunch of teens made it up,0

My granddaughter wanted this and loves it. She loves choosing the products to plant and then when ready picking them.,1
this game passes time away and is very addictive. it is way better than farmville. I would recommend. it to any who has a lot of time on their hands.,1
I absolutely love this!  Move on over farmville.  I love this game because I have problems loading farmville on m computer.  Farm story is very similar but so much easier and runs smoother.  AWESOME GAME!,1
it's additive! reminds me of mafia wars from myspace. I play all day if I could trying to get gems do I can buy more stuff,1
It's easy and so addicting.  Great free app.  Definitely recommend for all ages.  No problems ever.  It's fun talking with other farmers all over the world.,1
This is great for kids young and old :-) but I think the little ones it is great to let them play it .I tried it and it is fun. The little ones will love it .,1
"1st most of the stuff cost gems which u need 2 buy with real money.2nd its super boring,no goals,no nothing.What ever u do don't get this game!",0
Great game! It works great on my Kindle Fire. It is a a lot of fun. It is my favorite game that I have.,1

I tried this game and found it too juvenile for my tastes.  I deleted it after about 10 minutes.  This would be a great kid game on a long trip.,0

"So fun. I highly recommend it to you. I played it for at least a half hour straight. I don't have much money, but I'm planning to buy a tool shed for a house. It's the cheapest.  Wow. I could spend all this time telling you HOW fun it is.",1
this is a very fun game and it is even better because I have a kindle fire very very good game,1

Keeps ongoing. Crops grow you pick and I keep going. Trying to be self sefishent and spent ne real money,1
DONT ADD ME but id is lizzy8989 all story games are awesome but this is the awsomest one tip: DONT BUY GEMS,1
"like many other games, your play is limited unless you actually pay for things. otherwise this app gets boring REALLY quick. try Zoo Club instead. much more fun, and you don't have to pay.",0
Addicting! You find yourself very caught up in not only your farm but visiting &amp; obtaining &quot;neighbors&quot; as well. The only aspect that I'm not crazy about is the need to obtain &quot;gems&quot;. Which can cost real money!,1
"...my farm is my ""get-a-way""...i spend hours ""on the farm"" and ""visiting"" the neighbors...i really enjoy planning and designing the layout of my farm, earning the money to buy the improvements on my wishlist and visiting neighbors and the community to ad",1
love this game. easy enuff for my grand daughter to play.but it does have a problem connecting at times and we lose our crops,1
plz add me I'm new to the game and will water and tip daily my storm id is Bettyboop2 if you need a neighbor I'm here,1
"This game is pretty good, but it has a fatal flaw. A ton of kids are getting harassed on this game and getting bullied. Its like the movie Cyberbully. I deleted this game after the harassment became to much.",0
very fun I'm having no problems!I tried to download it before but it didn't so I tried again and now it works!,1
I love this game a lot!But now it says there is an updated version you can download only on the app storeI only have a kindle fire thats regular! Plz helllpppp meeeIm afraud my flint corn will wither if i dont collect my crops!,1
I HATED this game! It was so pointless because you have to buy almost everything with gems. It was truly  stupid. :(,0
"I have this game...Restaurant Story & Bakery Story. All are so much fun to play! Many boo-hoo these games because they think u have to spend real money on gems to play, this is not true. You get 2 gems for each crop/tree you master! There are 4 levels to",1
Kindle Fire User. I love the game. You do NOT need to buy anything. If you are concerned about auto purchases you have the option of requiring password confirmations for in-game purchases.,1
I LOOVVEE this game!!! i recommend this game for everyone!!! I also recommend all the teamlava games too they are so much fun and its pretty much all I play!! by the way if you want to be my neighbor my id is teralikespickles in all of them!!!,1
There is plenty of stuff you can get without gems. I don't know about this game because you can't download it on kindle fire. But city story is awesome sure all it is it tapping but isn't that all any game for a tablet or smart phone is?,1
"Great knowing that your kids know how hard a farmer works! In this game you get to grow crops and go to other people's farm like your neighbors and the community. I would advise playing this on the Kindle Fire or Tablet, so it would be clear.Hope this re",1
listen people...you CAN buy them for real $$$ IF YOU WANT to...it don't force you to buy any thing...it will try BUT you may decline if you want to...at least give this app a freaken chance BEFORE you rate it 1little star just because of that...plez peop,1
"I absolutely LOVE this game, but I tried to play today &amp; it's telling me that the version is no longer available, to download an update. So go to the app store &amp; there isn't an update &amp; in the game when you click on the update message, it tak",1
for someone like me who has only a few quiet moments in a day this is perfect. if you're patient you can advance every few days.  annoying how pricey the gems cost - it'd be 5* if they made them a better value.  I haven't bought any just on principle,1
"If you don't want to spend cash, go to menu, settings, in -app purchasing, and disable. Easy as pie :)",1
I miss staying in the farm. It reminds me of my childhood. I love it really.. five stars for this.,1
"have played game on kindle fire and hd kindle works great only downfall can't do achievements to win awards,but it is a very fun and every changing game.",1
"I have always liked this game, I play it on my iphone and find it very enjoyable. More games like this are needed for the Kindle.",1
"I do enjoy farm story. I determine how much time I have to dedicate to playing so it doesn't control me, I am in charge,although it can be addicting, so farm at your own risk...Happy Farming!!!",1
I really like this game because it has many different options and settings.  This game is a way for city people to experience farming. Farm Story is good for all ages!,1
YOU NEED TO GET THIS APP. PLZZZ ZZZ ZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ. ZZZZ ZZZ ADD IMGODSGIRL! ! ! ! ! FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN,1
this sucks...I cant even purchase the app because it asks tor a credit card from amazon account...its suppled to he free I don't get it at all...,0
I love this game great for all ages. It does let you buy things with real money withing the game so I would lock it in parental controls if you have a young child. Otherwise this game is great.,1
I totally love this gave. It is fun growing plants and veggies. I can make new friends and get to see how they make their land. I really like it alot,1
"THE BEST GAME EVER FOR  EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY , THE KIDS AND OLDER PEOPLE ARE LEARNING  A LOT AND PLAYING .",1

you can do any. thing you want but it is not free but it ia really fun you should try. it every day,1
i played farmville for a very long time so when i seen this i decided to give it a go and that lasted a few days at the most..this game is very bad things are to expensive and the lay out is not good either..and it froze up alot,0
"It is a great game. what people don't understand is that you don't have to buy the gems, you can earn them. slow process earning gems, but still, you can EARN them.",1
"Games by TeamLava take exploitation to a ridiculous level! The ability to build funds and awards to purchase items is slow tedious and works in real time. A friend of mine bought this game for her granddaughter. After she played the game for a few hours,",0
"this is similar to farmville from facebook. this is fun, you don't have to play it all the time because most plants take over an hour to grow... similar apps by team lava include bakery story and restaurant story... fun and somewhat addictive...",1
I L - O - V - E  IT it is fun and easy too. it is great for kids,1
Pls add warcraftgirl.  Super fun game.  I play most of the teamlava story games.  This one in particular is one of my favorites.,1
fun game.  it is very additive and I can not wait to check my crops.  needs to have crops and flowers with shorter timers.,1
This is a fun little story game that kept me entertained.  I&apos;d love to see more levels.\n\nI like the details.,1
Been playing since feb every day now i cant says no longer supported?? Here we go again with teamlava and amazon!!Where is the updated version for kindle? Come on teamlava we know it is your fault i will never play another TL game again it's ridiculous w,0
Enjoyable and relaxing.  Runs well on kindle fire.  Don't need to purchase anything unless you want to grow quickly (farm size and content).  I enjoy taking my time planting crops and tending animals.  Nice graphics also.  Good job TeamLava.,1
This game is really easy but watch out for your money! You can get at another level in seconds! There are only 2 crops that are free and millions of other crops to choose from. You can invite friends too by E-mail or Skype!!!,1
I love this game!!!! Fun way to pass time. If I could change one thing about this game it would be to have more chances to gain gems instead of purchasing them.,1
I love it. I asked my parents what to choose either this game or city story. Then my mom said only 1 game. Then she said download 1 and play it then you can download another,1
Reminds me a lot of the way Farmville was at one time.  Very enjoyable and you can play it as often or as little as you like.  The only downside is trying to find neighbors to help out.  I've wound up having to visit the Farm Story page on Facebook where,1
okay this is so much fun! I recommend you get it cause it's fun on a kindle fire and when ur bored it is fun to play! get it.....it is free!!!,1
I really really love to play this game (: I'm just really hoping goals would be added to it like restaurant story of bakery story. I'm more of follow the goals type person. Other then I play this game pretty much like crazy,1

I love taking care of my farm  with  all  my animals and garden too  I think  other people will love thisgame very much.,1
this game is so stupid I trier to collect my plants but it wont let me I know this app is free but don't waste your time playing it,0

"but this game is awesome. And I should know, I'm a player. This game is fun, interesting to most, creative, ADDICTING, and strategic. When I say addicting, I mean ADDICTING. This game has kept me up most nights tending to my crops and animals, earning co",1
It wouldn't work for me.  I didn't get what to do.  There were no goals or anything. It was very confusing.  Not worth it,0
"I have enjoyed this game so much.  If I get tired of playing the regular game, I try the advanced for a while and I am glad to get back to the regular game. Lots of fun.",1

farm story is a fun low stress game. it does not make your heart race and that is just what I wanted. Instead you plant your garden and wait for things to grow. The variety of plants animals and buildings complete with fences and paving stones is amazing,1
"I'm an avid online gamer. Im usually a console only gamer but this little farm game has pulled me away from my 360 for a very unexpected reason, the online community. You work together with people you meet in the game to expand your garden. By watering r",1

I like choosing what I can grow and moving thing where I want them.  I enjoy visiting my neighbor's farms and seeing what they do.  the only downer is that I haven't found any way to earn jewels to get the cool stuff.  don't want to spend a lot of cash j,1

"This game is so cool! I love all farming games, but I wish there was a lot more farming games. Love the animals. My kids likes to play this to. I download this game for them and I started playing and I love it. I play it more then my kids do.",1
